<small>BARNES&mdash;THE PREPOSTEROUS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>If Barnes had been asked to define the one thing
lacking in the scene before him, he would probably
have answered sentimentally, &#8220;A woman&mdash;a young
and very fair woman,&#8221; not that he had any definite
figure in mind, but simply because from an artist&#8217;s
view point the picture, wonderful as it was, seemed
now like a marvelous setting without its jewel.</p>

<p>A light breeze from the West, heavy with summer
incense, wafted through a golden-moted silence
and across a turquoise sky with cotton-blossom clouds.
Dense, yet of gossamer fineness; massive, yet light
as thistledown, they took their course placidly
without disturbing the perfect serenity of their
background. In their constant changing, they appeared
at times like Spanish galleons with every full-bellied
sail straining at its ropes. But they cut
no churning path; they left no oily wake. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
only cast calm shadows which in their turn swept
majestically over the green valley below them. The
heavy-leaved trees, the fat grasses, the daisies and
roadside ferns found themselves first in the stark
sunlight, then in the quiet shade, then in the brazen
sun again.</p>

<p>If Barnes had not been in tune with it all, he
would have felt out of place here on the top of the
long hill up which he had just climbed by the
saffron road. As it was, he surveyed the scene with
an air of easy content. To a passer-by he might
have given the impression of being a large proprietor.
In his heavy walking-boots, his belted
trousers, his flannel shirt gathered in at the throat
with a light tie, his checked English cap, and his
walking-stick, he looked as though he might be
making a walking tour of his landed estates. He
had a comfortable air of princely sovereignty. His
even features, his tall erect frame, his gray-blue
eyes, and above all his thin, straight nose carried
out the illusion. He had an air more of Bavaria
than New England. But his firm lips, surmounted
by a bristling blonde mustache, trimmed short and
in a straight line, together with his Saxon hair,
marked him of a hardier race. He might have been
a Dane, but his cheek bones were too high for that,
and there was too much good humor written large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
about the mouth. As a matter of fact he was from
New York state and his ancestors had fought under
Schuyler. His great grandfather was quoted as
having said, &#8220;I&#8217;d rather be killed as a private
under Schuyler than live, a captain, under Gates.&#8221;
A sentiment his father had paraphrased when he
raged at the walking delegate who tried to unionize
his shops, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go broke by myself before I&#8217;ll get
rich under you.&#8221; From that day Barnes, Sr., had
moved from one apartment house to another in
New York city in a steady crescendo of advancing
rentals until now he needed a secretary to look after
the tipping alone. And &#8220;The Acme Manufacturing
Co.&#8221; was wrought in iron scrolls across the
oven doors of half the cook-stoves in the United
States.</p>

<p>This fact, however, had less to do with Barnes
to-day than the more romantic one that his father
in the days of beginnings, married his book-keeper,
a fine-souled English girl, niece of the late Lord
Dunnington. Her father, a younger son, came
to America to make his fortune, died soon after,
and left the girl penniless. To-day the one romantic
spot left in Barnes, Sr., was his ambition to
accumulate a fortune so vast that it might overawe
his caddish English relatives. It was the mother
in Barnes, Jr., and not the father who now stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
upon the top of the hills dreaming into the cotton-blossom
clouds.</p>

<p>His pose was misleading. Barnes was proprietor
of nothing but himself. That was much or little
as you happened to feel about it. To himself it
was enough to make him glad that he stood here
to-day even with only a trifle over ten round dollars
to his name. The position was of his own
choosing. He might have been secretary to the
Acme Manufacturing Co. had he wished, instead
of a painter of very good water-colors which as yet,
however, had not found so ready a market as the
cook-stoves.</p>

<p>The father put it bluntly when he declared,
&#8220;People must eat to live; they can worry along
without pictures.&#8221; Perhaps. But he couldn&#8217;t.
He could worry along better without cook-stoves,
as he was proving.</p>

<p>But when a gay shaded patch of blue seen
through the straggling cloud-mist made him think
of his mother&#8217;s wet eyes as they were when in something
of a temper he had quit the gorgeous apartment
house for good, it occurred to him that his
father might have been less irascible about the
matter. The man had some grounds for temper
to be sure. In college Barnes had devoted himself
to Fine Arts and similar subjects when the elder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
not recognizing the courses as expressed in the
University cipher code, had thought him working
assiduously at economics and other useful branches
of manufacturing. Then, too, instead of studying
the market conditions of Europe when abroad, he
had used the opportunity for living a bit in the
Latin quarter and visiting the galleries. He reported
home that so far as he could see, people
over there had to have pictures; they could worry
along without cook-stoves. But even so, he couldn&#8217;t
stand being browbeaten like an errant schoolboy,
and therefore when matters came to a crisis he
packed up his sketch-book and started on a jaunt
through the Catskills, where Rip Van Winkle had
found surcease before him.</p>

<p>Below him stretched acre after acre of farm
lands made rich by three generations of toilers.
Gray stone walls told bluntly what the task had
been. They gave the scene a history such as crumbling
castle walls lend to English landscapes. The
farms swept down a valley cut by a lazy lowland
stream, which looked as though it might furnish
good trout fishing. He turned to the left and saw
through the birches bordering the road what he
had not before noticed&mdash;a red brick house half
hidden behind a row of elms. Just above, a wagon
track led to it. He took a position where he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
see the house more in detail. He caught a glimpse
of a white-pillared porch and a Dutch door, the
upper part swung open. The brass handle shone
brightly in the sunshine. To the left there was a
capacious barn with chickens scratching industriously
before the open door. From somewhere came
the coppery tinkle of homing cows. It looked like
a place where for the asking one could get milk and
honey and good rye bread.</p>

<p>The rural free delivery carrier jogged up the
hill and, stopping to drop some mail in a letter-box
out of sight behind the hedge, nodded a cheery
&#8220;Howdy&#8221; to Barnes and jogged on again. This
man in his officious Federal uniform destroyed
something of the sleepy atmosphere of the place.
&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; he seemed to declare as boisterously
as the circular letters of the Acme Manufacturing
Co. &#8220;Here I am, dear sir or madame, and beg to
remain most respectfully yours, the United States
of America.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes, who had opened his portfolio with an
idea of sketching the spot, closed it again, tying
it in one of those hard knots which invariably in
the end he had to cut. But he was checked by a
sound from the direction of the letter-box. At
first he thought it was a distant whip-poor-will.
It was low and had the same note of subdued pathos.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
Then he concluded that it was a straggling brook
running with gentle sobbing among the ferns. But
the peculiar sound soon became more individualized.
It took on a human note; then a feminine.
Finally he awoke to the fact that it was nothing
else but the sobbing of a woman. He strode up
the grass-grown road to the hidden stretch beyond
the fringe of trees. There he found himself confronting
a young woman who was kneeling upon
the grass, bowed above an open letter in her lap.</p>

<p>She was not over twenty, but tall and lithe. Her
heavy hair, black and silken, lay coiled about her
head in heavy braids. She was dressed in white
with a collar of exquisite lace fastened at her throat
with a turquoise pendant. A great orange-colored
cat arched its back in apparent sympathy against
her skirt. The soft grass had muffled his approach
so that for a moment she was unaware that she was
not alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he apologized, hat in hand,
now not at all sure that he ought to be here.</p>

<p>She was upon her feet in an instant. She looked
as though about to run. The cat challenged him
with a little spit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; he hastened to explain, &#8220;but
what you had met with an accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked whole enough. He surmised that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the letter was the cause of her agitation. If so,
he certainly was intruding. Her black eyes, full,
Italian, swept by long lashes, seemed to tell him so.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;it is nothing; just bad
news. It came so unexpectedly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips moved rhythmically to the music of a
sweetly lyrical voice. Her teeth were as white as
those of the orange-colored cat. She fitted marvelously
well into the scene above the valley. Consequently
he parried a little to prolong an interview
to which he knew he had no right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Luckily, bad news generally does come unexpectedly,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>She flashed a look at him as though to fathom
his intent. Then she glanced swiftly towards the
brick house and seemed instantly in her grief to
forget that he was there.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will kill him,&#8221; she exclaimed below her
breath.</p>

<p>Still he hesitated, impressed by the weight of
her sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I may be of any service,&#8221; he ventured,
&#8220;I&#8217;m on my way to the next village. Any letter
or wire&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No! Such news travels only too quickly,&#8221;
she answered. Her brows contracted. She went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
on more to herself than to him, &#8220;If I could only
check it before it reaches him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He,&#8221; mused Barnes, is at once the most personal
and impersonal of pronouns. Next to &#8220;She&#8221;
it is the most pregnant with possibilities of all
human utterances.</p>

<p>He wondered, too, how it would be possible to
paint a black that had gold in it; an ivory that
had rose in it; a pure white that had blue in it.
It was not possible. And yet there they were in her
hair, her brow, and the setting of her pupils. The
tawny cat pressed close to her skirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I fear,&#8221; he said half in apology, half in
hope, as he prepared to leave, &#8220;that I can&#8217;t help
you. And yet,&#8221; he reflected aloud, &#8220;it seems as
though when ill fortune hits hard at anyone the
rest of the world ought to club in to help. There
ought to be a bad news insurance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face brightened. But instantly it clouded
again as she turned half away.</p>

<p>&#8220;But instead of that,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;the world
only raises barriers.&#8221;</p>

<p>She recognized his implied offer of help. If her
instinct bade her turn from it, there was something
in his sturdy presence, above all in his frank eyes,
which made him seem to stand for just some such
kind-hearted insurance as he had whimsically suggested.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
It was possible that he from his impersonal
point of view might be able to see more clearly than
she just what in such a crisis as hers was wisest.
At any rate, she said,</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about my brother. He won&#8217;t come home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes suppressed a smile. He had been prepared
for sudden death. He shifted his eyes from
her to the brick house now growing more mellow
in the softening twilight.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is his home?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded, watching him curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think a man ought to be eager to return
to such a home as that,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;He ran away,&#8221; she explained with some embarrassment
at expressing the more intimate details.
&#8220;He is somewhere in Alaska.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes acknowledged her confidence with a sympathetic
nod of his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he is in Alaska,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;it will be
only a matter of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just the trouble,&#8221; she exclaimed impulsively.
&#8220;That is the pity of it. It will be too
late!&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw that the boy himself was a mere episode
in some more poignant grief. He waited for her
to proceed. She said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I should tell you this&mdash;except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
that it&#8217;s a relief to tell anyone. Father is
up there waiting for him&mdash;with not long to live.
If he hears this&mdash;his heart&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her fingers closed convulsively over the letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;That <i>is</i> tough,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Your father
expected to see the boy himself to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to see him, but to hear him, to feel him.
Father is blind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s still worse. The boy knows of his
trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why won&#8217;t he come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because of a quarrel. He wrote this.&#8221;</p>

<p>She handed the letter to Barnes with a quick
motion as though in sudden hope that he might be
able to gather from it something she herself had
missed. He glanced it through. It was a thoughtless
letter. Its whole tone was one of boyish
bravado. Barnes flushed as he read it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the boy seems to need,&#8221; he commented,
&#8220;is a cowhiding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he has fallen into bad company,&#8221;
she apologized for him, but none too
heartily.</p>

<p>He checked his own opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe seems almost like a stranger to me,&#8221; she
confided further. &#8220;He has been gone five years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
now. And the last few years he <i>was</i> at home, I
was away at school.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes refrained from congratulating her. He
realized how really serious an affair she had upon
her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&mdash;you must tell your father this
yourself?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;and it&#8217;s like being ordered
to kill him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew in a deep breath that was half a gasp.</p>

<p>Barnes thought a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first thing I should do,&#8221; he advised, &#8220;would
be to tear up the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should never let him see that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment and then still half dazed
tore it into little bits. She tossed the fragments
to the ground. They were harried about the greensward
by a light sunset breeze. The yellow cat
began to play with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he advised, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t tell your
father anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he expected Joe to-day! That would leave
him to wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that better?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;the blind wait so hard.
There is nothing else for them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;But they suffer hard, too. While waiting he
could at least&mdash;hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He would guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A guess is never a certainty,&#8221; he persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be certainty enough to break down
his poor heart. Dr. Merriweather said that Joe
alone could keep him with us another week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes glanced again at the brick house. It
scarcely seemed possible that so grim a crisis as
this could center there. The situation struck home.
In some way he felt the responsibility of this unknown
young man&#8217;s action resting upon his own
shoulders. He, too, in a fit of anger had left a
father behind him.</p>

<p>At that moment Barnes was inspired by an idea&mdash;a
preposterous idea to be sure, but the present
situation was preposterous and so was Barnes himself
if his father was to be believed. Furthermore
most inspired ideas <i>are</i> preposterous. It depends
a good deal on how they turn out whether or not
that adjective clings to them forever. But this one
made even Barnes catch his breath. He had to look
again at the blue sky, at the gold in her hair, at
her eyes now misted like Loch Lomond at dawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is just one other course for us,&#8221; he announced
deliberately. &#8220;We might deceive him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>She started back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many up there must know of this?&#8221; he
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only Aunt Philomela,&#8221; she managed
to answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;The servants?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have heard of Joe but never seen him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The neighborhood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We moved here after Joe left.&#8221;</p>

<p>She answered his questions mechanically with
no suspicion as to what he was leading.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy was young? You say this was five
years ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lad changes a good deal in that time. Do I
resemble him&mdash;even remotely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>

<p>She studied him again as though for the first
time she had seen him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;must be now&mdash;about your
height.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough. A grown man may change in
every way except in height.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only a week or so. I am free. Why
couldn&#8217;t I play the son? Why,&#8221; he smiled at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the odd whirligig, &#8220;why couldn&#8217;t I play the
prodigal?&#8221;</p>

<p>She started back, her hands clasped to her breast,
her eyes grown big.</p>

<p>&#8220;How impossible!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And humane,&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>The word caught her attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be almost that,&#8221; she admitted reluctantly.</p>

<p>He waited. He did not care to press the point
by argument. It was merely a suggestion born of
the moment&mdash;born of the acute necessity of doing
something at once. But she must decide for herself.
He had done his best, and however it turned
this picture was worth remembering.</p>

<p>At first it did not seem to her even a possibility,
but once she recovered a little from the shock of
her surprise, once she had stripped it of its novelty,
and, gazing into his honest eyes, considered it
merely as an heroic measure for easing the sick,
blind man to his end, she found herself forgetting
everything else but the peace it might bring. She,
better than he, knew that it <i>was</i> possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;it is such a bit of
trickery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing else,&#8221; he assured her, &#8220;or diplomacy
if you wish to dignify it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;If&mdash;if we succeeded it would make his last
days very pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would do my best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is such an obligation&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me represent the world at its finest. Let me
found the bad news insurance company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you can&#8217;t afford to sacrifice so much
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll paint a picture or two. I shall be more
than repaid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an artist!&#8221; she exclaimed as though
that might account for many hitherto inexplicable
matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m striving to deserve that title,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>Her head was awhirl with the quick sequence of
unexpected events. But in the midst of it she still
grasped at this hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you,&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;be good enough to
meet my aunt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is very quick-tempered,&#8221; she explained,
&#8220;so you needn&#8217;t pay much attention to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the distinct advantage of quick-tempered
relatives,&#8221; he affirmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will come now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed readily. &#8220;And&mdash;it may be
helpful&mdash;my name is Barnes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>She shot a swift half-frightened smile at him.
&#8220;And I am Miss Van Patten.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>She led the way to the house, the yellow cat by
her side.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>THE COURTESY OF THE ROAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The little old lady sitting by the window in the
big living-room, as serene as Whistler&#8217;s portrait of
his mother, may have had a temper but if so, thought
Barnes as he entered at the girl&#8217;s heels, it was concealed
somewhere about her person other than in
her face. She was in black with a white cap sitting
as daintily light on her gray hair as the first flick of
snow on a silver fir. She was a tiny body with
shrewd black eyes and a firm thin mouth. Her
wrinkled cheeks still had color. She was busy with
a wisp of lace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Philomela, this is Mr. Barnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl spoke the sentence as though it were one
word. Aunt Philomela snapped up her head and
leveled her astonished black eyes upon a young
and decidedly good-looking stranger who was bowing
low. Then she shot them at the girl who had
turned towards him she had so abruptly introduced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been thrust so rather forcibly into the
honor of your acquaintance,&#8221; murmured Barnes,
&#8220;in the hope that I may be of some service.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>As he observed the lightning flashes beginning
to cut the dark of her eyes, Barnes suspected that
she had already found in the hidden depths of
them, the missing temper. The formal courtliness
of his introductory speech baffled her for a moment,
but now she observed in a sharp staccato,</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps my niece will explain where she had
the honor of meeting Mr. Barnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the hedge,&#8221; answered Barnes, assuming the
burden of the reply, &#8220;just by the letter-box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she is indebted&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Chance and the courtesy of the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the service you propose?&#8221; continued the
little old lady, clearly still bewildered. &#8220;A set of
books, perhaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evident that her wits were still keen.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Barnes, unruffled. He could
blame his portfolio for that accusation. &#8220;No,
though it&#8217;s a matter requiring equal tact if that is
possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The aunt, with a queenly nod of her white head
towards a chair, graciously gave him permission to
be seated, though the red in her cheeks was heightening
ominously. Barnes surmising that she was
struggling hard not to sacrifice her present advantageous
position to a quick tongue, resolved to put
the matter bluntly while yet there was time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;Your niece has just received a letter from your
nephew. He writes that he will not come home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My niece confided this personal affair in you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; she demanded, &#8220;is this true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That Joe refuses to come home? It is brutally
true, Aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl had turned her aunt&#8217;s hasty slur neatly.
Barnes met her eyes with understanding. As in
Miss Van Patten&#8217;s case, the grim fact was sufficient
to divert the aunt&#8217;s attention from everything
else.</p>

<p>&#8220;He refuses to come back at such a time?&#8221; she
repeated. &#8220;This is terrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then she
added,</p>

<p>&#8220;But this will break his heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced excitedly from one to the other of
them. The girl crept to her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will. It will if he learns of it. But he
mustn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mustn&#8217;t, Eleanor? What other way is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barnes&mdash;&#8221; began the girl.</p>

<p>The aunt glanced swiftly at the stranger again.
He met her eyes steadily&mdash;with perhaps the slightest,
the very slightest, gallant lowering of them in
respectful deference to her age.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;I fail to see how a stranger may assist in so
personal a matter,&#8221; she observed icily.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will let me explain,&#8221; said Barnes. &#8220;It
seems to me that no one but a stranger can help.
I&#8217;ve ventured to suggest that I be allowed to ward
off the blow; that I be allowed to do this in the
only possible way now open&mdash;by impersonating the
boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl straightened herself and waited. Barnes
put down his portfolio and accepted the chair which
had lately been offered him. Aunt Philomela sat
up as stiffly as though suddenly galvanized.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you actually seriously propose such&mdash;such
base trickery?&#8221; she stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;With the most honest intentions in the world,&#8221;
nodded Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are bold and impertinent, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still with the best intentions in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That does not excuse such knavery,&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>The girl broke in,</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt, if you&#8217;ll calm yourself and listen a moment.
You are unkind to one who has made so
generous an offer&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah,&#8221; interrupted Aunt Philomela, &#8220;it is too
generous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes made no reply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;I must ask Mr.&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnes,&#8221; he supplied as she hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;To withdraw at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes accepted the decision with equanimity.
He reached for his portfolio. But he was beginning
to like this little old lady.</p>

<p>The girl checked him with a spirit that was
authoritative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you be good enough to wait a moment,&#8221;
she requested, &#8220;until&mdash;until aunt goes upstairs
and tells father?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to her aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunty,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;you must tell father
that Joe refuses to come. You must tell him that
Joe is brutal about it. You may tell him that
there is no longer any need of his waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela quailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the letter?&#8221; she demanded feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tore it up. It wasn&#8217;t suitable for you to
read.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes leaned forward towards the little form
which had settled back wearily into the chair. His
eyes were tender and sympathetic but there was
nothing obtrusive in his attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;I am sorry for
you and would do what I can. If what I proposed
sounds absurd at first, you see that the only other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
alternative is cruel. If we can make the end come
peacefully and quietly, won&#8217;t it justify us somewhat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should you, a stranger&mdash;&#8221; Aunt Philomela
began suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you for your doubts,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;But at such moments as these, who are the strangers?
I would help an old man who was bruised by
the roadside; why not an old man who lies bruised
in his bed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>Barnes smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask your cook. I&#8217;m the son of the Acme Manufacturing
Co.&#8221;</p>

<p>The aunt for a moment doubted his sanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Also,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I paint water-colors&mdash;some
of them good, some of them indifferent, all of them
as well done as I know how to make them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you came here?&#8221; stammered Aunt Philomela,
still confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;To escape New York. Also for a bit of walking
trip to make sketches. For what else&mdash;God knows.
Perhaps for this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela studied him shrewdly and in spite
of herself his mouth started a twinkle in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole idea,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;is absurd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole situation,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;is pitiful.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; moaned Miss Van Patten, &#8220;it is. We have
no right to stop at anything which shall bring him
relief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no right to shirk our duty,&#8221; returned
the aunt with conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Duty?&#8221; queried the girl. &#8220;Is it our duty to let
father suffer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is our duty to bear our own burdens and not
shift them upon strangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no burden whatever in the undertaking,&#8221;
corrected Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you?&#8221; challenged the aunt.</p>

<p>That <i>was</i> a question. Why was he willing to leave
the pleasant freedom of the open road for a task
which could not be called in itself pleasurable?
The question was even more involved than the shrewd
aunt suspected, when the fact was taken into account
that he was even willing to act the prodigal&mdash;a
character for which he had a particular aversion. To
his mind the only decent way for the prodigal to
return was with the fatted calf over his own shoulders.
He must return triumphant, even if repentant.
Otherwise it behooved him to stay away in the
far country he had chosen and take his medicine like
a man. To be sure the present case justified itself,
but even so he did not altogether like the flavor of it.
Then why was this no burden? It was clearly simply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
a case of atmosphere. The house itself had something
to do with it, the gold in the girl&#8217;s hair had
something, so did the little old aunt herself with
the pink in her crinkly cheeks. He turned from the
aunt to the niece. Decidedly, he thought, she should
be painted on ivory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you?&#8221; repeated the aunt, pressing
home her point.</p>

<p>He glanced out of the window. The West was
donning her jewels; pearl, opal, and amethyst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;the day is very fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are indebted then to the sun?&#8221;</p>

<p>He avoided the obvious pun and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the sun, the month, the time of day, and&mdash;a
slight matter of temperament.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl lifted her eyes to his with a smile. The
aunt did not repeat again her salient question; instead
she frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my two eyes,&#8221; she answered enigmatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;The world is your debtor,&#8221; murmured Barnes,
chivalrously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunty, you ought to think of nothing but
father,&#8221; broke in the girl. &#8220;He will soon wake up
in the dark with the old question on his lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>There came to them even then the silvery tinkle
of a bell from upstairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; gasped Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>Her niece stood squarely before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no more time for argument,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;We must decide now at once. Either we must
accept Mr. Barnes&#8217; offer or&mdash;you must go up to
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; gasped Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to him, Aunt?&#8221; demanded the
girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear no,&#8221; she trembled. &#8220;It quite puts
me out of breath to think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it possible that he can be deceived
like this?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Barnes arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can only try. It looks in our favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then?&#8221; inquired Barnes, directly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Go quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which, though ambiguous, decided the matter.
Barnes left the room, following the girl who, quite as
out of breath as her aunt, led the way.</p>

<small>DREAMS OF THE OLD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>They had no sooner reached the head of the stairs
than a second tinkle came rippling fairy-like the
length of the white-finished hall from a room at
the end facing the West. Miss Van Patten paused.
But the orange-colored cat preceded them and
stepped daintily over the sill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we follow her Highness?&#8221; whispered
Barnes.</p>

<p>The girl shrank back a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we fail?&#8221; she gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; answered Barnes, &#8220;there&#8217;ll be nothing
left but to explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would he ever forgive us? Would he ever
trust us again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That comes later,&#8221; he reminded her. &#8220;We
haven&#8217;t failed yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much depends upon you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much more depends upon him. If his hunger
for the boy is great enough, he will forget everything
but the fact that he has at last something tangible&mdash;something
to grasp.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Again her eyes grew big as she studied him with
the feeling that not until this very moment had she
ever seen him before. Here in the intimacy of the
upper chambers the boldness of the act oppressed
her. Before, it had seemed only a theory, but now
it became an actuality. He himself felt it. It
would have taken little to have turned him back.
But at this moment the orange-colored cat returned
for them. Then the father called. Time was pressing.
She took the lead but Barnes with a quicker
pace stepped ahead of her.</p>

<p>At the door, he paused. He saw a large room
bathed in the glow of the setting sun. In one corner
stood a large four-posted bed. The white counterpane
stood out like a snow-sheeted pool among
evergreens. Bolstered up with fat pillows he saw a
face that would have served for a model of a saint&#8217;s.
He had but a second to study it and make his decision,
but that was time enough. It was a child&#8217;s
face grown old. White-bearded though it was, it
was still a child&#8217;s face. All the man-fret was
smoothed out of it, all the world marks rubbed
away. He seemed more like a son lying there than
a father. His eyes were closed and one thin arm
lay outside the clothes by his side. His face was
turned towards the door. The cat leaped upon the
counterpane and instantly the father raised his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>&#8220;Eleanor?&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>Barnes strode to his side as the cry escaped.
He placed a strong hand upon the thin arm. The
eyes though they remained closed seemed to strain
in that direction. The lips moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son!&#8221; he trembled.</p>

<p>Barnes bowed his head. That was a cry to go to
a man&#8217;s heart. He could not answer it. He felt
the gentle fingers play up his arm to his hair. He
felt them flutter over his forehead, his cheeks, his
chin. Then, kneeling, he waited for the second cry.
It came charged with such feeling as to bring a
strain to his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no doubt in it. It was a wild, glad,
embracing sob. It was the utterance of an empty
heart suddenly filled. He was breathing rapidly
from the excitement, but he freed his other hand
and with the two clung almost fiercely to the boy&#8217;s
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve come back,&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Barnes, finding his voice, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice for a second seemed to startle the old
man. His hold relaxed. The girl who had crept to
the other side of him raised her head with her eyes
fixed on Barnes, scarcely breathing. The old man&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
eyelids fluttered as though he were straining to
force them open.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come back,&#8221; repeated Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can feel you, but your voice&mdash;Oh, it&#8217;s
enough now that I can feel you! I&#8217;ve often heard
your voice, lying here but&mdash;but my hands were
always empty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl breathed again. Barnes met her eyes.
He nodded encouragement. It was as he had
thought; the fact of a living tangible presence here
was enough to dispel all minor doubts.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been gone so long,&#8221; faltered the father,
&#8220;I&mdash;I had forgotten. I expected to see you as you
were when you left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a boy when I left,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, and I was not boy enough. You&mdash;you
forgive, Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for you to forgive, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your voice has grown kinder. Eleanor&mdash;you
are my eyes. Help me to see him as he is to-day.
He is taller?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is tanned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see him! I can see him! He has grown
handsome, my boy, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>She met Barnes&#8217; eyes steadily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I think you could say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Philomela?&#8221; he demanded suddenly.
&#8220;She should be here to see my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is downstairs, Daddy. She&mdash;she was a
bit overcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What wonder? This goes to one&#8217;s head.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lay back upon the pillows, his breath coming
brokenly. Barnes feared for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must not stay long, father,&#8221; he ventured.
&#8220;You must rest a little. I&#8217;ll come up later.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt the sudden grip of Van Patten&#8217;s fingers
upon his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is so much for you to tell. I&#8217;ve lost five
years out of your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are all the days to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be many&mdash;many to make up for
the days that have gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will try to bring back those days to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are glad to be home again, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Barnes answered truthfully. &#8220;You make
me glad to be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are so many things,&#8221; he faltered. &#8220;But
your aunt must see you. She is not as strong as I
am. I&mdash;I am afraid she is failing a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will rest now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can rest now. Boy, you have brought <i>me</i>
home.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Barnes pressed the feeble hand and rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I send John to you?&#8221; asked the daughter.
&#8220;Do you need anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing more,&#8221; he answered, as he sank back
wearily among the pillows. He looked like a man
who had come to the end of a long journey.</p>

<p>Barnes started out.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be downstairs? You&#8217;ll be where I can
call you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>The girl stopped and kissed her father&#8217;s thin lips.
He reached up his hand and smoothed her hair a moment.
Then his arm fell and he seemed to sleep,
dropping off quickly as a child does.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela had not moved. When the two
came in again, she glanced up swiftly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Barnes. &#8220;It is well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you were successful in your deception?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten crossed to her aunt&#8217;s side and
kissed her gray hair. She kept her face hidden
there for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt! Aunt!&#8221; she choked. &#8220;If you could
have seen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Between anger, shame, and relief Aunt Philomela&#8217;s
lips trembled. But she answered sharply,</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank the Lord I was saved from all active
participation.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;If you could have heard his glad cry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have been ashamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in spite of her answer the corners of her
mouth grew less tense and the little patches of rose
upon her cheeks returned again. Barnes felt glad
of that. With her spirit up, she seemed less formidable.</p>

<p>&#8220;He accepted you without suspicion?&#8221; she inquired
of Barnes as though she could not yet believe it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In such blind heart-hunger as his,&#8221; he answered,
&#8220;there is little room for suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Truly,&#8221; she answered tartly, &#8220;my brother must
be quite blind.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a relief from the tension of the last few minutes,
Aunt Philomela&#8217;s sharp tongue came as a relish
to Barnes. He had never in his life passed a more
uncomfortable quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are worse things in the world than blindness,&#8221;
he suggested.</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten raised her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid&mdash;almost afraid that father&#8217;s eyes
would open and he would see again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a guilty conscience could inspire such a
fear,&#8221; snapped Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to have him happy?&#8221; challenged
her niece. &#8220;He is sleeping now&mdash;the first
time for two days.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;He is sleeping?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We used to give him powders to make him
sleep and forget. Isn&#8217;t this a better way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleeping powders, my dear, do not operate upon
the whole family!&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I so dull?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was referring to their dream properties rather
than their soporific,&#8221; Aunt Philomela answered with
some magnanimity and yet with suspicious point, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a distinction between dreaming and
sleeping,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;A clear distinction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might mark all the difference between a poet
and a bore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is little harm in bores,&#8221; declared Aunt
Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;You flatter me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have drawn a wrong deduction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you flatter me still more. I had never
thought of myself as a poet. However, if you fear
the dreams&mdash;an old man&#8217;s dreams&mdash;it is not too
late to withdraw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should call it a great deal too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered decidedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll frame some
sort of an excuse for returning to Alaska to-morrow.
It may be a bit clumsy but I can make it answer.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re an adept at that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for you to decide what we shall do,&#8221; he
insisted.</p>

<p>The little old lady hesitated. She disliked very
much being cornered in such fashion. But Barnes
had caught the worry in the girl&#8217;s eyes and realized
the necessity of having this settled at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is already decided,&#8221; she fenced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only as far as this. He has his dreams for to-day.
That is something. To-morrow is not decided.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten started. Barnes waited relentlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; faltered Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>Still he waited. Miss Van Patten started to interpose
but he checked her with a glance. The silence
grew oppressive.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right,&#8221; squirmed Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; he interposed. &#8220;You alone have the
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she snapped. &#8220;I suppose we must.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s the only way,&#8221; he agreed quietly.</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten embraced her aunt excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d approve,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon compulsion,&#8221; interjected Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; warned Barnes, &#8220;I refuse to have it so.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>&#8220;Of circumstances,&#8221; added the aunt quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which prompt us to every act,&#8221; threw in
Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wise and unwise,&#8221; commented the aunt grimly.</p>

<p>Barnes allowed the matter to drop leaving Aunt
Philomela with the last word which she accepted in
an unmistakable spirit of victory.</p>

<p>The girl was all activity at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must show Mr. Barnes to Joe&#8217;s room and
then supper will be ready,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>As she met her aunt&#8217;s eyes she blushed with pretty
embarrassment but she immediately tripped out of
the room and soon returned with John.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; she ordered. &#8220;You will make Mr.
Joe&#8217;s room ready at once. You will follow him?&#8221;
she asked, turning to Barnes.</p>

<p>It was neatly done. With a bow to Aunt Philomela,
Barnes made his exit.</p>

<p>The room to which he was led had been prepared
for weeks. It faced the East. It was large and was
furnished with a huge black walnut bed, a cool matting
of green, a great high-boy with brass handles,
and a bureau with drawers two feet deep. White
dimity curtains fluttered at the windows. But for
the moment John interested him more than the
homely furnishings.</p>

<p>John was as stoical as an English butler. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
short, stout, and of that non-committal middle age
which ranges between twenty-five and forty. He met
one&#8217;s eyes with a sort of timid stare and a suggestion
that he knew and he would tell. There was a nodding
mystery about him. He made Barnes feel like
searching the room to see what it was that the man
silently hinted might be concealed. John was a
piquer of curiosity&mdash;a caballer with the unknown.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; suggested Barnes after the man had
thrown back the spread, shown him his bath, and
glanced about significantly for his baggage. &#8220;John,
I think you&#8217;d better look under the bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>John obeyed and stared so long into a dark corner
there, that Barnes took a position on his knees
beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see anything move?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Move? Where, sir?&#8221; John gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over there. A sort of&mdash;Thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may have been mistaken,&#8221; Barnes admitted,
&#8220;but perhaps we&#8217;d better examine the
closets.&#8221;</p>

<p>John crossed the room with some hesitation and
with many backward glances. He opened the closet
door the matter of a foot and peered in. Barnes
coughed. John darted back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything there, John?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>&#8220;What&mdash;what did you expect, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A sort of&mdash;Thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; answered John eagerly and with conviction,
moving deeper into the room. &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothing of that sort there, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; explained Barnes. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just come
from the frozen North. There are many strange
things there&mdash;very strange things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may go.&#8221;</p>

<p>John accepted his dismissal with alacrity.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there are to be mysteries here,&#8221; commented
Barnes to himself. &#8220;We may as well have them
picturesque.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>QUESTIONS OF DIPLOMACY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>At the round table covered with sun-bleached
napery and silver that caught the candle light until
it seemed ablaze, Aunt Philomela, with a diplomacy
equaled only by that of King Arthur, had so arranged
the places that no one could tell who sat opposite
who. She herself presided at the quaint old silver
tea urn, so that naturally marked the head of the
board. But Barnes and Miss Van Patten were
placed equi-distant from her on either side so that
they did not face one another.</p>

<p>On the table were damson preserves, a clear crimson
as of molten rubies; milk-white bread; a bowl
of crisp salad fresh from the garden; and a pitcher
of milk so heavy with cream that it poured the
lightest possible shade of coffee-color.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela had freshened herself in a purple
gown relieved by spider thread lace. Her niece
was in a gossamer white China silk sprinkled with
blue polka dots. In her black hair she wore a
tortoise-shell comb surmounted with old gold scroll
of the finest Venetian workmanship. It was just
the touch needed to bring out the Italian richness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
of her features. She might now have been presiding
at some old Patrician board with the chanties
of the gondoliers floating in at the open windows,
except for Aunt Philomela, stern as a Puritan conscience&mdash;and
the damson preserves. On the whole
Barnes liked her better in her present setting. To
them all came the song of a whip-poor-will mourning
to his mate beneath the purple sky in the
orchard just outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;How will you have your tea?&#8221; asked Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;With cream, Aunt Philomela, no sugar if you
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten held her breath. Aunt Philomela
sat fixed with the tongs poised over the square
sugar bowl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such audacity!&#8221; she choked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only speaking my line,&#8221; he hastened to
explain. &#8220;The servants, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it quite necessary,&#8221; put in the girl, hastily
bringing up re&euml;nforcements at the sight of her
aunt&#8217;s snapping eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will take me some time to get used to it,&#8221;
added Barnes. &#8220;You see I haven&#8217;t the good fortune
to have a real aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an unpardonable liberty,&#8221; protested Aunt
Philomela, unreasonably.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8220;And you must call me Joe,&#8221; he hurried on,
&#8220;and I must address your niece as Eleanor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes himself was a little breathless after that.
He found himself studying the damson preserves.
Had he looked up he would have found them a good
match for Miss Van Patten&#8217;s cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no help for it,&#8221; agreed the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; trembled the aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, is there?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;How else
can he address me before the servants?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can at least refrain, when the servants are
<i>not</i> in the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dropped two lumps of sugar into Barnes&#8217;
cup.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please,&#8221; murmured Barnes, &#8220;no sugar,
Aunt Philomela.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela corrected her mistake by adding
another lump. Barnes accepted it with a murmur
of thanks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he continued more at ease, &#8220;John
already has his suspicions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has?&#8221; exclaimed the aunt uneasily. &#8220;But
he has never seen Joe! He has been with us only
since we came here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All I know,&#8221; Barnes answered, &#8220;is that John
looked under the bed and in the closets before he
left me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>The aunt did not disclose the fact that this was
one of John&#8217;s nightly duties in the modest room she
occupied next to her niece&#8217;s, but the latter&#8217;s eyes
warmed into a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps that was mere force of habit,&#8221; hinted
Miss Van Patten.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela turned a warning glance upon
her niece&mdash;her cheeks coloring daintily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It made me realize that I ought to know more
about myself,&#8221; Barnes continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were precious little good,&#8221; vouchsafed the
aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must I act up to my reputation?&#8221; he asked
solicitously.</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten put in kindly,</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you will have no difficulty in living up
to the Joe my father found to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it wise to idealize the boy as far as
possible,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten served him with salad and a
portion of the damson preserves.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there are certain details,&#8221; he persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to idealize Joe, you&#8217;d better
leave out the details,&#8221; advised Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;I referred more particularly to the historical
details,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;There is for instance the
question of my age.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>&#8220;You will be twenty-three next October,&#8221; Aunt
Philomela condescended to inform him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. Then I suppose I ought to know
the ages of&mdash;my relatives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which matches well with your other presumptions,&#8221;
answered the aunt with heat.</p>

<p>But here Miss Van Patten took the matter into
her own hands and sketched for him as delicately as
possible the brief career of this only son. She told
first a little something of the mother who had been
dead ten years now and of the blow this was to the
father. Mr. Van Patten had practically retired,
when this occurred, from the bank where he had for
so long been president. For a few years they lived
on in New York, with Aunt Philomela, her mother&#8217;s
sister, filling the gap as best she could. Joe even as
a child had been hard to handle and when he grew
up became very willful. He did not like school and
so Mr. Van Patten, when the boy was sixteen, found
a position for him in the bank. But he was restless
there and did not stay long. He tried one thing after
another without success and finally when rebuked by
his father, left home altogether. During these years
she herself had been away at school and so had seen
little of her brother. After the boy left, her father
broke down and upon the advice of the doctors came
back here in the hills. They had been here now five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
years living very much to themselves. From time
to time they had heard from the boy in his wanderings,
locating him a few months ago in Alaska.</p>

<p>It was an undramatic narrative and yet as it fell
from her lips Barnes listened with keen absorption.
Or was it merely to the melody of her
voice? After she had ceased, he found himself
still listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I serve you to more tea?&#8221; interrupted
Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>Barnes thoughtfully stirred the thick syrup in
his cup.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not, thank you,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see,&#8221; added Miss Van Patten, &#8220;there
is not very much for you to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he smiled, &#8220;I&#8217;m not so black as I was
painted. But there are still some other things I
must post myself on. I would like&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I positively refuse to surrender my private
papers,&#8221; objected Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;An atlas,&#8221; Barnes finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;An atlas!&#8221; gasped Aunt Philomela, taken by
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;An atlas. I must study my geography. The
most I know of Alaska at present is that it&#8217;s the
home of polar bears. Are you familiar with the
habits of polar bears, Aunt Philomela?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>The girl smiled. That was what Barnes had
wished.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I fear I can&#8217;t assist you in that fabrication,&#8221;
Aunt Philomela answered curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a bear in the park,&#8221; he informed her.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve often watched him. Upon that subject at
least I may speak with some authority. But there
are many other things in Alaska. Eskimos, for
instance. I&#8217;m a little weak on Eskimos. In the
pictures they look much like the bears except that
they carry harpoons. There are also the details of
mining&mdash;have you ever been interested in mines?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; scowled Aunt Philomela. &#8220;In a weak
moment Joe persuaded me by letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearly that was a delicate subject. He swerved
away from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must post myself on names. I recall only
Nome, White Horse, and Dawson.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl smiled again.</p>

<p>&#8220;That <i>is</i> a complication,&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Father is sure to question you. He is interested
in travel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best to instruct him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re justified in imposing upon
a helpless old man,&#8221; declared Aunt Philomela,
severely.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear aunt,&#8221; returned Barnes, amiably, &#8220;all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
of us stay-at-homes are imposed upon by our traveling
brothers. I have a friend who has been to India
whom I have often confuted with the aid of an encyclopedia.
Unless I&#8217;m mistaken, my stories will
compare favorably with any Joe himself might tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t be much more untruthful,&#8221; the
aunt admitted, thinking of her mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;That gives me a pleasant margin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of one fact I can assure you,&#8221; she further volunteered,
&#8220;gold does <i>not</i> lie around the hills in
chunks&mdash;at least not in the vicinity of &#8216;The Lucky
Find.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a note of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which I hope will prove more valuable than my
nephew&#8217;s notes.&#8221;</p>

<p>John stole in at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is calling for Mr. Van Patten, Miss Schuyler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Schuyler? Barnes received a pleasant surprise at
the name. His ancestors had fought under Schuyler
and now fortune had decreed that he himself should
enter an engagement with one of that hero&#8217;s descendants.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela glanced towards Barnes with
something like reliance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, John,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be right
up.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>He turned to his hostess.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I hope that the ladies will not have retired
before I return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be assured of that fact,&#8221; answered
Aunt Philomela with decision.</p>

<p>He had no sooner left the room than she confronted
her niece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she demanded, indicating clearly that
she still held the girl accountable for the whole situation.</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten lowered her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make it very hard,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; snorted the aunt. &#8220;What have I to do with
it? I wash my hands of the whole affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;after you
asked him to remain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked him to remain? I? When that great
tall man stood over me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>In her indignation she could go no further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why he wouldn&#8217;t hurt you. He wouldn&#8217;t hurt&mdash;anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you <i>see</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the aunt, &#8220;I can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One need only look at his eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped. Her aunt had a most embarrassing
way at times.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;I suppose he means well enough,&#8221; admitted the
aunt more kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can he mean anything else? What has he
to gain by giving his time to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not easy to understand men&mdash;especially
young men,&#8221; affirmed Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything to understand, when one
is just kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A great deal more sometimes than when one is
merely unkind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten met her aunt&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;if you could have seen
the joy in Daddy&#8217;s face you wouldn&#8217;t bother yourself
with suspicions. We haven&#8217;t any right to consider
ourselves at all in this matter. We&#8217;ve saved
father a great grief. Isn&#8217;t that enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>The aunt shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been swept
on by your emotions. You don&#8217;t realize the seriousness
of what we&#8217;ve done. We&#8217;ve taken into the intimacy
of our family a stranger&mdash;a young stranger,
about whom we know nothing. Supposing any of
our relatives should swoop down on us from New
York? What would they say? What will our
friends about here say? What will Dr. Merriweather
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl answered quietly,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>&#8220;What does all that matter when you think of
what we&#8217;ve saved Daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Matter? It would mean nothing short of a
scandal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten flushed. But she answered still
quietly,</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re mistaken, Aunty. But even that&mdash;what
would that matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah. You aren&#8217;t out of your swaddling-clothes
as far as the world goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl crept closer to her aunt. She placed her
hand upon the thin shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunty dear, if you found an old man bruised
by the road, would you hesitate? Do we need a
stranger to show us how just to be kind? That isn&#8217;t
the way you&#8217;ve helped the poor with Dr. Merriweather.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela looked steadily into the young
girl&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m seventy-two and
you&#8217;re twenty-two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must I wait until I am your age before I&#8217;m
human?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps&mdash;before you learn that you <i>are</i> human.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the aunt asked an apparently irrelevant
question,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;Is Carl coming over to practice with you to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been thinking of Carl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to introduce him to this
stranger?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; observed Aunt Philomela as she rose
from the table, &#8220;there are more complications here
than you think of.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two made their way into the sitting-room.
The aunt took a chair near the window. Miss Van
Patten remained standing, looking out into the dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall send a note to Carl telling him I&#8217;m engaged
for this evening,&#8221; she concluded. She gave
the letter to John and then returned. Aunt Philomela
remained staring at the door. It was a full
half hour before Barnes came down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alaska,&#8221; he announced, sinking into a chair in
the ark, &#8220;Alaska is said to be a cold country, but
at times it gets most uncomfortably hot there.&#8221;</p>

<small>THREE-FINGERED BILL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Barnes noted that Miss Van Patten had a personality
which asserted itself even in the dark.
Though he could see nothing of her more than an
outline, he was able to follow every expression.
This made it easier to understand how the blind
father gave himself up completely to that other
illusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you ring for a light, Eleanor?&#8221; requested
Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dark is very restful,&#8221; hazarded Barnes.</p>

<p>He rather enjoyed the situation. It gave his
imagination freer play.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dark may keep us all in better countenance,&#8221;
assented the aunt tartly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You left him happy? He suspected nothing?&#8221;
inquired Miss Van Patten, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I left him asleep,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s good. He hasn&#8217;t slept at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has worried a great deal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been enough to break one&#8217;s heart to hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
him call for Joe night after night in the
dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If ever I meet the boy,&#8221; observed Barnes with
impressive deliberateness, &#8220;I shall try to make him
live for himself the hour I&#8217;ve just lived for him.
I listened to a saint, feeling like the Devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand how Joe had the heart to
hurt him,&#8221; choked the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t <i>have</i> the heart&mdash;that&#8217;s the trouble,&#8221;
answered Barnes. &#8220;No one in the world will venture
so far to give us pain as our own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;For sheer mercilessness,&#8221; added Barnes, &#8220;give
me a relative. It made me squirm to have to save
the boy from the shame he deserves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can we ever thank you for this!&#8221; exclaimed
Miss Van Patten.</p>

<p>&#8220;By letting me stand face to face with the boy
sometime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela broke in.</p>

<p>&#8220;This act is not like Joe. He was never brutal.
I don&#8217;t think he understood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He probably didn&#8217;t understand. That&#8217;s
the brutal part of it. It&#8217;s the brutes who don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with some heat&mdash;more than he intended,
but he was still fresh from that interview.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
The old man&#8217;s grip was still on his arm; those
sightless eyes were still straining into his. He still
heard the irregular breathing and the panting questions&mdash;childish
questions, trivial questions made
great by the love back of them. And to these he
had been forced to give lying answers which would
never have been accepted save for this same great
love and trust. He needed now to be diverted from
the memory of it. He was eager to stir up Aunt
Philomela&mdash;to turn to the lighter side of it though
even the comedy of it was tragical.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re going to be consistent travelers, Aunt
Philomela,&#8221; he began, &#8220;it will be necessary for me
to repeat my story to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is travelers the word?&#8221; she snapped back.</p>

<p>&#8220;The more polite word at any rate,&#8221; answered
Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe in calling a spade a spade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t any reason for calling everything
a spade,&#8221; he ventured to suggest. &#8220;What I
was forced to tell him didn&#8217;t have sufficient truth
in it to make it a lie. It was pure fiction. I am
sorry I didn&#8217;t have more time for preparation. My
effort was necessarily in the nature of an inspiration.
It was crude. It made me sorry that when
a boy I neglected physical geography.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela groaned.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you did the best you could,&#8221; declared
Miss Van Patten. &#8220;It was a very awkward position
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was to say the least humiliating. He asked
a great many questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will probably ask still more of Aunt Philomela,&#8221;
he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he does!&#8221; she exploded.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he does?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;this is disgraceful! We&#8217;re getting in
deeper and deeper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Barnes finished, &#8220;we will hold him
high out of the water as long as we can. Shall I
repeat to you what I told him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; broke in the girl, &#8220;our stories must
agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The best I could do was to paint a picture,&#8221; he
half apologized.</p>

<p>&#8220;Picture making is your profession, I believe?&#8221;
questioned Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered slowly. &#8220;But <i>my</i> public
has eyes. There are some advantages in painting
for the blind. But, for that matter, many supposedly
good eyes <i>are</i> blind.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>&#8220;And many supposedly weak ones are sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. The soul is the vision. I remembered
the heading of the boy&#8217;s letter&mdash;&#8216;The Last Chance&#8217;&mdash;and
so had a starting-point. Given, too, the mystical
white name &#8216;Alaska&#8217; and what setting ought
we to furnish a penniless young man with more
spirit than heart? It was only a guess but I chose
this: a green-blue sky, brittle, stinging; a panorama
of white undulating to a horizon shrouded in
virgin snow; in the middle distance a few slab
huts; in the foreground a closer huddling of camps
with the gaudy sign of the &#8216;Nugget&#8217; saloon conspicuous.
In the single street, bearded men as ungainly
as bears in their heavy clothing, glancing with
fevered eyes now towards the &#8216;Nugget,&#8217; now towards
the rugged banker mountains. Lean mongrels attached
to sleds, passing from time to time, but no
other animals; no birds, no felines, no wasted
brute life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess stole across the room and sprang
into the girl&#8217;s lap. She passed her hand over the
silken hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;The notable other buildings,&#8221; continued Barnes,
dreamily, &#8220;are the post-office, the bank, the assayer&#8217;s
offices, all of which are distinguished by
their signs. In the bank the sheriff has diplomatically
taken up quarters. So much for the stage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>&#8220;In a shanty on the outskirts of the settlement,
sits Joe&mdash;sits myself. I am in heavy trousers
tucked into cowhide boots and wear a bearskin
coat. I am studying a batch of papers. They are
the giddily-printed stock certificates of &#8216;The Lucky
Find.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know them,&#8221; nodded Aunt Philomela, now
quite lost in the narrative.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m indebted to you for that suggestion,&#8221; answered
Barnes. &#8220;I pore over the papers for a
minute and then go to a corner where there&#8217;s
a stout wooden chest marked &#8216;Joe Van Patten,
His box,&#8217; I take out a package of letters from
home. I place them on the table and my eyes
grow moist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw the boy blubber in my life,&#8221; objected
Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t interrupt,&#8221; protested Miss Van
Patten.</p>

<p>&#8220;While I&#8217;m thus sentimentalizing,&#8221; Barnes hurried
on, &#8220;enter&mdash;three-fingered Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah,&#8221; interrupted the aunt again.</p>

<p>&#8220;The name isn&#8217;t mine,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;I stole it
from a magazine story. Besides, Bill was falsely so
called&mdash;they neglected to count his thumb. Bill
is a rough dog with whiskers like an anarchist but
with a kindly heart beating beneath his faded pink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
sweater. This was a relic of the days when he
served as a rubber down at prize fights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pleasant companion,&#8221; snorted Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;A useful one, at any rate. He greets me with a
cheery &#8216;Hello, pard, back in the home camp?&#8217; I
guiltily thrust the packet aside and we come down
to business on how most advantageously to use our
relatives in the matter of the gorgeous stock certificates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Bill was responsible for that!&#8221; exclaimed
the aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Responsible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For disposing of that worthless paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>She checked herself quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; she added, &#8220;that you didn&#8217;t hint to
Mr. Van Patten what I inadvertently let drop
about &#8216;The Lucky Find.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was very cautious about particularizing in
any matter capable of substantiation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t for the world have him know. The
loss&mdash;er the loss was slight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes felt his heart warm towards Aunt Philomela.
It would have warmed still more had he
known that this investment involved half her scant
property.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mentioned the fact that Bill with his wider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
experience held out very bright prospects for the
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was thoughtful of you to lay it to Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Van Patten instantly offered to assist me to
the limits of his means.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you dare allow him to invest&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t even any gilded certificates,&#8221; he reminded
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. I forgot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is merely a picture. As you see picture
making can be the most harmless of occupations.
We artists produce the effect, without the danger;
we present the rose, without the thorns; we develop
our mines, without certificates. I assured
Mr. Van Patten that this was no time to invest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did very well,&#8221; Aunt Philomela complimented
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. Following this I went into the
details of the cold weather, but&mdash;you know all
about that. I assured him that I was warm and
that I had plenty to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy hasn&#8217;t been able to take food at all
without wondering if Joe were hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was well supplied, I assure you. He wished
to know more about my friends and so I introduced
him to Sam Foss, a most likeable fellow; Ranston,
an old college friend of mine out there somewhere;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
and Bart Stanton, a Massachusetts Technology
graduate. So you see my friends averaged up
pretty well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They certainly were an improvement on one
fingered Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Three</i> fingered Bill,&#8221; he corrected, &#8220;you must
be careful of your details.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall venture to repeat nothing,&#8221; she asserted.
&#8220;And you think he believed all that nonsense?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As an eager child believes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she mused sadly, &#8220;he <i>has</i> become
a bit childlike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a child when listening,&#8221; Barnes continued,
&#8220;but when he talked to me it was the
father who talked. I&#8217;m sorry the real child who
wrote the childish letter didn&#8217;t hear what he said
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. Aunt Philomela waited expectantly
and so, too, did her niece. But he told them nothing
more. That which was not part of the dream&mdash;that
which was sober reality, he had no heart to repeat.</p>

<p>&#8220;That concludes my report,&#8221; he said as the silence
remained unbroken.</p>

<p>Again a silence. Then Miss Van Patten spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been most kind to us. It&#8217;s hard to
know how to thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t necessary. I&#8217;ve been well repaid&mdash;if
that were essential.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somewhere about the house an old clock chimed
nine.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;We retire early in the country,&#8221; she said
wearily, &#8220;I&#8217;ll call John.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. I trust your dreams will be pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will be of Alaska. I feel it in my bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They might be worse located&mdash;on a summer
evening,&#8221; he hazarded.</p>

<p>She swept like a royal dowager towards the door.
The girl followed but stopped a moment before
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you again,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;Good
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, with the Princess close behind her, she too
swept queen like from the room.</p>

<p>As with something of a sigh Barnes half turned,
he found John beside him as though he had come up
through a trap in the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; faltered John, wondering what else
his master&#8217;s son had expected, &#8220;will you follow me,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lighting a candle, the man escorted him to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
room where the dimity curtains were bulging in
from a brisk night breeze. As he placed the flickering
light upon the dresser, Barnes inquired,</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t seen&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord, sir. No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, John. You may go.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went, leaving Barnes to the fragrance of the
night. The dark of the orchard made him think
of her hair.</p>

<small>THE MYSTERY OF A VISION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Barnes awoke in the morning to the reveille of
robins and thrushes. With chirp and whistle and
flute note, they sang him from his hearty sleep to
a still heartier realization of a new-born day. For
a moment, from the motherly lap of his broad bed,
he blinked at the dimity curtains and the age-ripened
hautboy. What strange caravanserai was this? It
was always a pleasure to wake to the memory of the
long tramp of the preceding day&mdash;to trace his
path from the brisk setting out of the previous morning
to the final lagging steps at dusk. To-day he
traced his course as far as the letter-box and then
came to himself as though fresh from a plunge in a
mountain brook. But he had no time to think about
it before there was a timid knock at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; called Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your warm water, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>John stepped over the threshold. His stride was
confident. He was bold enough in the daytime
whatever he might be at night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>&#8220;Miss Schuyler&#8217;s compliments, sir, and we breakfast
at eight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What time is it now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. My compliments in return to Eleanor
and I will be ready at eight.&#8221;</p>

<p>John betrayed wonder. Barnes reviewed his
speech. Then he himself betrayed even more wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear, John?&#8221; he demanded sternly,
in a clumsy attempt to retrieve himself. &#8220;My compliments
to my aunt,&#8221; he paused, &#8220;and I will be
ready at eight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes unconsciously looked about for his dress-suit
case. Then he remembered that he had checked
it to the next village, thinking at first to ride through.
He did not have so much as a razor. He glanced
at John&#8217;s smooth-shaven face, hesitated, and then
asked,</p>

<p>&#8220;John&mdash;didn&#8217;t I leave a razor behind me?
Seems to me I remember a black-handled one. If
you could find it&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Now John was in many respects an admirable
man in his calling. If he was positive no razor had
been left, he had at least a razor of his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see if I can find it, sir,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>He was back in five minutes with the entire outfit
which he placed upon the dresser without a word.
Barnes was immensely pleased with his cleverness,
while John, who had been the really clever one,
remained impassive. Furthermore, being in high
good humor at the success of the ruse which had
saved him from the humiliation of borrowing from
the man, Barnes leaped from his bed so suddenly
that John jumped half way to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; inquired Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You came so suddenly, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I <i>was</i> a bit abrupt. The morning gets
into your blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Arctic weather I presume, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Ah, yes, that is probably it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to lather his face but John still delayed,
shuffling a bit nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You left &#8216;The Lucky Find&#8217; well, sir?&#8221; he ventured
with an apologetic cough. It was as though
he spoke of a lady. It was as though he spoke of an
intimate friend in whom he took great interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty well, thank you,&#8221; answered Barnes in
some surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reads as how you brought twenty million in
gold out of the country last year, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not you alone, sir, but all the mines together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
I didn&#8217;t know but what &#8216;The Lucky Find&#8217;
had a share in it, as the sayin&#8217; goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes caught his breath. Then he carefully
lathered one ear. It didn&#8217;t need lathering any
more than his shoes. It was something of an automatic
movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; he asked quietly, &#8220;how much stock
did you have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much, sir. I haven&#8217;t saved as much as I
might. But when I saw the papers you sent on
to the mistress, I mailed what I had. It was only
a thousand, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember now. A thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes turned back to the mirror. He wiped the
lather from his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring my trousers, John.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reach in the right hand side pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>John brought out two five-dollar bills.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put one of them back.&#8221;</p>

<p>John obeyed and held the other one in his hand
uncertainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Barnes, &#8220;is our first annual dividend.
It should have been sent to you before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir. I didn&#8217;t hope for so much,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may go,&#8221; said Barnes, picking up his razor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Barnes completed his dressing with dispatch. It
occurred to him that if he hurried he might possibly
beat out Aunt Philomela, and so have a few
words with the girl before she came down.</p>

<p>As he stepped into the living-room, Aunt Philomela
greeted him with a curt nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust three-fingered Bill didn&#8217;t disturb your
dreams,&#8221; he observed with polite interest.</p>

<p>The girl was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah. Something worse,&#8221; snapped Aunt Philomela
as though she held him directly responsible
for it. &#8220;It was half a walrus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps that is the Thing John was looking
for,&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>He turned towards the window in the hope that
he might discover Miss Van Patten in the flower-gardens.
They blossomed just beyond&mdash;a medley
of sweet alyssum, mignonette, heliotrope, cosmos,
and marigolds. She was not there.</p>

<p>&#8220;To what do you refer by the Thing?&#8221; demanded
Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Thing he looked for under the bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The color stole into her cheeks making them look
more than ever like cameos.</p>

<p>&#8220;In these days, with so many strangers on the
road, one cannot be too careful,&#8221; she avowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;I understand that many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
estimable persons even in New York make it a
habit to look under their beds.&#8221;</p>

<p>At length Miss Van Patten came in. She was
in white again with a loose crimson tie at her
throat. She looked as though she might have been
in the garden after all&mdash;growing there like the
other flowers for she had a freshness that only the
dew can give. She greeted him with a smile that
brightened the room like the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy is in better spirits than I&#8217;ve seen him
for a year,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;He asked for you as
soon as he woke up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps then I had better step up there for a
minute before breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you? He&#8217;s waiting so impatiently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He repeated to me what you told him. You
didn&#8217;t tell us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She blushed prettily, timid at sharing with him a
secret in which her aunt for the moment was not
included.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most everything,&#8221; he replied uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind because he told me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She feared that he might consider it in the light
of a confidence betrayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered sincerely.</p>

<p>But lest she go further into the subject he turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
abruptly and made his way again to the room of
shadows.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela at once faced her niece.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this great secret?&#8221; she demanded somewhat
piqued.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I ought to tell you,&#8221; replied
the girl with a tinkling laugh which was like the
ripple of water over pebbles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon my presumption,&#8221; snapped the aunt
cuttingly, as she assumed her state dignity.</p>

<p>This consisted of standing so erect that she crinkled,
drawing her chin the slightest bit in, and folding
her hands at the level of her waist. The girl
promptly stepped forward and kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was partly of you he spoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela drew back with a more genuine
emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an impertinence!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy evidently asked him if he saw any change
in you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mr. Barnes told him he thought you had
grown younger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall thank William not to discuss me in the
future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but your ears would have burned if you&#8217;d
heard the rest.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>&#8220;What wonder! To allow a stranger to discuss
such intimate matters is&mdash;is almost indecent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember it was as Joe that Mr. Barnes spoke.
But,&#8221; she added thoughtfully, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure Joe
himself would have spoken so beautifully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The bold, young fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The most wonderful thing of all,&#8221; continued
the girl, her eyes growing wistful, &#8220;was the way he
talked to Daddy about mother. How was he able to
do that when he never knew her&mdash;never saw her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother,&#8221; replied Aunt Philomela, soberly,
&#8220;would never forgive me if she knew I countenanced
such goings on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was he able to do it?&#8221; repeated Eleanor,
her thoughts spanning a decade.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela scanned the girl&#8217;s face anxiously,
lovingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;La, dear,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;He spoke of her eyes&mdash;describing them as
woodland pools at twilight. You remember mother&#8217;s
eyes were just like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear. They were like that&mdash;like your
eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He spoke of the tender sweetness of her face&mdash;of
her black hair with the gold in it. You remember
the gold in mother&#8217;s hair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear. Your hair is much the same.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;He even described her skin. He said it was
like ivory with rose in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Aunt Philomela, noting the rose
now in the ivory of her niece&#8217;s cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounded almost as though he were standing
in front of mother, didn&#8217;t it? It is as though
he saw a vision!&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela pressed her lips firmly together.
When, a moment later Barnes himself came in,
she kept her eyes fixed upon her niece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; she announced, &#8220;I shall ask Carl to
come over this morning.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE CALL OF THE ROAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>As soon as Mr. Van Patten dropped to sleep for
his morning nap, Barnes determined to suggest to
the girl a plan he had conceived during breakfast.
That it would impress Aunt Philomela as audacious
he had no doubt; that it would meet with kindlier
interest from Miss Van Patten, he dared hope.
With the decided improvement in the old gentleman&#8217;s
condition the spirit of the whole household
rose high. Not only had he slept well during the
night, but he had partaken of a fairly good breakfast.</p>

<p>The morning hour had also been easier for Barnes.
Mr. Van Patten had clung to the young boy&mdash;the
boy before he had become himself and was still
merely his father&#8217;s boy. Barnes had scarcely more
to do than listen. Alaska had been forgotten.</p>

<p>The morning itself, too, gave courage. The sun,
now in supreme authority, held in the bondage of
shadows every unsightly thing and marshaled forth
to the front its legions of the beautiful. Everywhere
it put youth in command; chief of all on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
saffron road which ran before the brick house and
later connected with other roads which in turn
connected with still other roads until a path was
made clear across the continent.</p>

<p>The road summoned forth. It beckoned. The
wonder was, thought Barnes as from his window he
caught glimpses of it winding in and out among the
trees up the hill and so on, either way, until it ran
straight into an ocean&mdash;the wonder was how these
young fellows hereabouts resisted its call. If a
man but followed it in its intricacies he would pass,
on the way, every palace and hovel in the land.
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief, a traveler
would come upon them every one. These tawny ribbons
drained every spring of human life. They
demanded their toll of time from all the world. And
in the end, when the legs failed, all the world was
finally borne over this same road and lowered to one
side of it. The wonder was, then, that instead of a
few dreaming poets and a few lawless vagabonds
that all the young men in the world were not caught
by the spell of the highway and the pageant it
promised.</p>

<p>But what of the spell of the houses by the side of
the highway? They cried halt to the young men.
Ah, there lay the explanation&mdash;the road after all
was subservient to the houses by its side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>But there were many houses by the side of the
road; how did each house choose its own? By the
eyes of the women who dwelt in the houses. Clearly
then, the houses themselves were subservient.</p>

<p>Were the eyes of the women then the final masters?
Here was a problem for a philosopher. He
knew only that he himself had been stopped, with
the road beckoning him on.</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten was busy for an hour with her
household tasks before she returned to where Barnes
had stationed himself at the foot of the Dutch door.
A snow-white apron made her look very business-like.
Aunt Philomela was for the moment carelessly
absent. Here was Opportunity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had in mind,&#8221; he said, &#8220;going to the next
village for my suit-case. I checked it there thinking
at first to ride through but the station below
here tempted me and I got off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send John for it,&#8221; she replied, wondering
that she herself had not anticipated his need. The
reason was, though her modesty made her refrain
from offering the explanation, that she never associated
baggage with men folk. To her they were
always as untrammeled and unburdened as her
saddle horse Aladdin.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I looked forward to the walk,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;I thought that perhaps you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she exclaimed again. But this time it was
an entirely different sort of an &#8220;Oh.&#8221; It was a shy,
fluttering monosyllable&mdash;resembling a bird who,
flushed from its nest, flies but a little way. Her
eyes reflected a certain eagerness&mdash;her quick glance
towards the door a certain timidity. Her cheeks
assumed a compromise.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be just an easy turn, down and back,
wouldn&#8217;t it? The sun is calling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Aladdin had been chafing three days in his
stall unheeded by his mistress, whinnying an answer
to the bugle call of this same sun as it sifted
in through the chinks. But the most satisfaction he
had found was in her whispered solace, &#8220;To-morrow,
perhaps.&#8221; Yet of all living things outside the
house, she loved him best.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be very pleasant,&#8221; she confessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I may go,&#8221; she determined.</p>

<p>Which proved&mdash;what? It is very difficult to
prove anything at all but this at least would seem
to prove that Aunt Philomela was not as vigilant
as she might have been. She came in just as the
girl was adjusting her hat of brown Leghorn&mdash;in
fact at the moment that Barnes was engrossed in
watching the bewitching operation of the tying of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
pert bow of damson-colored ribbon beneath an ear
which looked of too delicate workmanship to be of
any actual use. But that it was seemed evident from
the fact that it detected Aunt Philomela&#8217;s steps long
before his own of coarser fiber heard anything at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an art,&#8221; declared Barnes to the little old
lady as she stood in the doorway, a living human
question mark. &#8220;It&#8217;s an art to be able to tie a bow-knot.
I&#8217;ve practiced twenty years and succeeded
only in developing an affair with dropping ends
which won&#8217;t come untied.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela did not display as much interest
as she might in this statement. She was one to go
to the heart of things. She was not to be decoyed
from the nub of a situation. Very well, then, he
decided, she should have it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor and I,&#8221; he informed her, &#8220;thought of
taking to the road.&#8221; He added immediately not so
bold as he had determined to be,</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get my bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John is at your service,&#8221; snapped Aunt Philomela,
instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But John isn&#8217;t able to exercise for me; John
isn&#8217;t able to drink in the sun for me. There are
many things that John couldn&#8217;t do for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was clear these considerations had little weight
with her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ll come along too?&#8221; he ventured.</p>

<p>If it had been within the realm of possibility for
her to make her feeble limbs wag over those four
miles she would have taken him up just to foil
the childlike innocence with which he veiled his
sense of confident security. Even as it was, she
contrived to frighten him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will order the carriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>But here Miss Van Patten herself interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too fine a day to drive,&#8221; she declared
sensibly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be back by the time father wakes.
Do you want anything at the village?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t for the world burden you,&#8221; Aunt
Philomela answered, coldly.</p>

<p>Which, on the whole, thought Barnes, was a reply
unworthy of her.</p>

<p>So it happened that within less than twenty-four
hours, Barnes took up the trail again&mdash;with a
difference. In the first place he no longer carried
his portfolio. Moreover he did not miss it. And yet
he had not proceeded a hundred yards before he
passed material enough to fill it. He gave scarcely
a glance at the old patriarchs of apple-trees looking
like muscle-knotted dwarfs engaged in the absurd
task of supporting green apples no larger than
marbles; at the sturdy pines whispering Norwegian
sagas, the lithe birches, and the shivering poplars.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>&#8220;Daddy and I have taken this road so many
times. He loves it,&#8221; exclaimed Miss Van Patten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he does!&#8221; he nodded.</p>

<p>She turned her eyes towards him in some amazement
at his assurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand Daddy so well,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The big emotions,&#8221; he declared thoughtfully,
&#8220;make us all of kin. Man-sorrows draw men
together as women-sorrows draw women together.
Sound us deep enough and all men are brothers, all
women sisters. Sound us still deeper and even sex
vanishes; we become just comrades.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Philomela proves the rule? I wish she
were in better humor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t for a fortune have her change,&#8221; he
returned quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind her sharp tongue?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It relieves me of a great responsibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Philomela,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;is attorney for
the world. There&#8217;s nothing like a stiff prosecution
to stiffen one&#8217;s own defense&mdash;if it&#8217;s a fair one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was doubtful but she thought she saw, which
is quite as satisfactory.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a way your aunt&#8217;s opposition is the old case
of Art versus Reality,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;the Academy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
versus the Acme. But Lord forgive us, the controversy
is a purely scholastic one. If we only get
deep enough in our thoughts, as in our emotions,
we find ourselves again all one. Aunt Philomela
isn&#8217;t so suspicious of me as she is of my portfolio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t really ferocious,&#8221; she assured him.
&#8220;And she <i>does</i> appreciate your kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, at any rate, doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The change in father this morning is marvelous.
It made me know that we&#8217;re doing right&mdash;however
strange it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it seem strange to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly is&mdash;unusual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose it is and yet it isn&#8217;t anything
more than the road led me to expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it is to be a man,&#8221; she smiled.
&#8220;Women are allowed to expect so little.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was studying her mouth. It was so simply and
yet so marvelously drawn. He had decided it was
a child&#8217;s mouth, but at this he glanced up quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; he said, &#8220;women are the mothers of
expectancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away her head without replying. She
was a bit shy of his loose generalizing. She brought
him back again to her father. She made vivid to
him the days of close comradeship she had passed
with the old gentleman during these last two years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
After this he led her out to tell him more of the
neighbors and of her life among them. He listened
for the names and made it a point to fix them in
his mind. Among them as she rambled on there
was one Carl Langdon, he noted, who stood out a
bit more than the others. Langdon it seemed,
played a violin and she herself was musical. He
refused to satisfy his curiosity by pressing any
further along this line than she of her own accord
led him. Yet, as it was, there were several little
things about Langdon which excited his interest.</p>

<p>Before they knew it, they reached the beginning
of the descent which led into the village of white
houses huddled at the foot of the surrounding hills,
like sheep pressing warm sides together against a
blizzard. At the glimpse of the steel path of the
railroad, Barnes impulsively turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we go back?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>So they retraced their steps over the same road,
which yet seemed to him a new road. On the return
he found himself reciprocating her confidence by
telling something of his own life. It seemed an uninteresting
enough tale and yet he found her listening
with apparent eagerness. In fact before he
knew it she had led him a great deal further than
he had intended to go. He had proposed covering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
only the blunt facts of his life such as their present
relations gave her a right to know, but before he
realized it he had gone into a great many more intimate
details.</p>

<p>It was not until they were within sight of the
house, that he awoke to what her eyes had enticed
from him. Then he drew himself up short, a bit
startled by the phenomenon. He was usually reticent
about himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he apologized, &#8220;I must
have bored you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t,&#8221; she answered frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I had no idea of going
into those matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled again and this time he saw that her
mouth was after all not a child&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela met them at the door, as though
she had been some time waiting for them. She fixed
her eyes upon the girl as though to discover at a
glance what this morning contained. Then she
turned to Barnes, raising her scant eyebrows a
trifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You gave your bag to the marketman to bring
back?&#8221; she asked blandly.</p>

<p>Bag? Bag, to be sure. It was a blow straight
from the shoulder. It was another case of where he
had not carried out his original intentions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;I have decided,&#8221; stammered Barnes, &#8220;that if
you will be so good, you may send John for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the other things you mentioned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been able to attend to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was trying to edge by into the house.
Aunt Philomela stopped her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carl is waiting in the sitting-room for you,&#8221;
she announced. &#8220;He is anxious to meet&mdash;your
brother.&#8221;</p>

<small>AN ESTIMABLE YOUNG MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Barnes found himself shaking hands with a pleasant
looking young fellow of twenty-two or three who
had a thin, earnest face and curly brown hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;This <i>is</i> a surprise,&#8221; exclaimed Langdon, &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know Miss Van Patten had a brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did come as a bit of surprise,&#8221; admitted
Barnes, &#8220;but so did you for that matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten was taking as long a time as
possible to remove her hat. Her cheeks were decidedly
scarlet. But she did not run as Barnes half
expected her to do. She returned and dropped into
a chair before the two men.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is as good as a story-book, Miss Van Patten,&#8221;
exclaimed Langdon.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better than a story-book,&#8221; she laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I received your note last night I thought
you must be ill or something. Miss Schuyler said
this morning that you had gone to walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she murmured uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;We went after my baggage,&#8221; explained Barnes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;So Miss Schuyler said. She tells me you&#8217;ve
had lots of interesting experience in Alaska. I
tried to get her to repeat some of your adventures
but she told me I&#8217;d have to wait until I saw you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; grinned Barnes, &#8220;but she knows almost
as much about them now, as I do myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like getting them first hand,&#8221; said
Langdon.</p>

<p>He turned to Miss Van Patten.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid we&#8217;d have to give up our duets if
you had a guest. But we can go on with them now&mdash;mayn&#8217;t
we? Unless Mr. Van Patten needs
quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s much improved,&#8221; the girl assured him.</p>

<p>Langdon entered into a rhapsody over some new
music which had just been sent him from New York.
Manifestly Barnes was not needed here. He made
his apologies.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I say,&#8221; exclaimed Langdon as Barnes was
leaving, &#8220;I want to hear something about that
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whenever you wish,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>He retreated to the library and finding paper
there sat down to write home. He headed his letter
&#8220;Schuyler headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Mother,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I saw your eyes yesterday
in the straggling mist of some cotton-blossom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
clouds and they brought you very near to me. This
is a wonderful country. I know that enough of you
has survived the apartment houses and the Acme to
allow you to enjoy it if you were here. The hawthorn
in your blood would respond to the glad sunshine
and the unsmirched sky. And the quiet too
is such as you would like. You remember the walks
we used to take in the Park on clear mornings
when it seemed like a fairy island? It is like that
here. I want to thank you right now for the times
you took me to the Zoo. I didn&#8217;t think then that
the information I picked up would prove so valuable.
I don&#8217;t know what I should have done here
without my knowledge of polar bears. One of the
great delights of Art is that sooner or later every
tittle of information one picks up is used. Art
wastes nothing except time.</p>

<p>&#8220;My exercise has kept me in the best of condition.
This morning I made only four miles but before that
I have consistently covered fifteen. I think I shall
linger a little here. I&#8217;ve found material for a big
picture. The subject is different from anything
you&#8217;ve ever seen of mine. I think even father
might appreciate this. I&#8217;ve about decided to attempt
it in oils; a sort of study in black and gold
and damson preserves.&#8221; He scratched out damson
preserves and substituted crimson. &#8220;I&#8217;m uncertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
about the size of the canvas. Sometimes I
think it ought to be heroic, like the Santa Barbara
at Venice, and at other times I feel as though I can
convey the impression of its fineness only in a miniature.
Then again I feel as though it ought to be
swept in with bold color strokes, and at other times
as though it ought to be just suggested in grays.
You see&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Someone came to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; apologized Miss Van Patten, &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know you were here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in for a moment?&#8221; he pleaded.
&#8220;Has Mr. Langdon gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has returned for his music.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He plays very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the flute?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The violin. He has studied abroad. He&#8217;s
here for the summer visiting Dr. Merriweather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&mdash;you play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the &#8217;cello&mdash;but only a very little. I&#8217;m
afraid this&mdash;this new complication is going to be
rather embarrassing. I don&#8217;t like to tell Carl
untruths.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t. Leave that to me. Won&#8217;t you
come in?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>She hesitated and then stepped in resolutely. She
settled comfortably into a big chair on the opposite
side of the library table.</p>

<p>&#8220;At first,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I thought only of Daddy
and Aunt Philomela. But now that others are
brought in, it doesn&#8217;t seem quite right to them, does
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems inevitable and what is inevitable is
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head,</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re mistaken. But at any rate
what is inevitable is inevitable. There seems nothing
to do now but make the best of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She appeared genuinely worried. He tried to
change the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was writing home,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t disturb
you. When one is writing home one needs absolute
quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was still standing. She thought he had a very
soldier-like appearance. He really looked more
like a soldier than an artist as she had conceived
artists. Even his blond mustache had an aggressive
military air. It was trimmed so short and cut
so straight that it challenged the suggestion that it
was there merely for ornament.</p>

<p>He returned quickly to the first subject.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>&#8220;I myself did not by chance have anything of
a musical education?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You refused to practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is just as well. Yet I remember the story of
a French prisoner who to save his life, learned to
play upon a trumpet in a single night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Luckily you won&#8217;t need to do that but I think
you could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Luckily for Mr. Langdon. Otherwise we should
have a trio.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had risen and was now nearing the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come in and listen to us?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>He reflected a moment to keep her longer by the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he decided, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll not, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Carl seemed quite anxious to see more of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he will&mdash;the best I can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must run up and see if father is awake,&#8221; she
said and vanished.</p>

<p>With a sigh Barnes returned to his letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might paint her in an open doorway,&#8221; he
wrote, &#8220;upon the point of leaving. She would be
half turned, posed in so light a fashion that the
onlooker would be half afraid she was about to vanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
from the canvas. She should appear startled as
though hearing the approach of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced up. Aunt Philomela stood in the
doorway. He rose again. She paused uncertainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in?&#8221; he welcomed her bravely
though she looked suspiciously as though loaded
for bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought Eleanor might be here,&#8221; she observed,
as though she expected him to feel guilty.</p>

<p>&#8220;She left only a moment ago,&#8221; he answered
frankly.</p>

<p>She appeared to be taking aim.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was writing home,&#8221; he took her into his confidence
to ward off as long as possible whatever
might be coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought artists had no homes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary they have more homes than anyone
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that depends upon your definition of
a home,&#8221; she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;To my mind it is where one is brought up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord forbid,&#8221; he gasped, thinking of the apartment
houses.</p>

<p>&#8220;And where one&#8217;s own kith and kin are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if one got married&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite another matter,&#8221; she snapped so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
decisively as to forbid further argument along this
line.</p>

<p>But one must have a subject, thought Barnes, or
one could not tell what subject Chance might introduce.
Aunt Philomela had the self-conscious air of
one who has approached with a mission.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was writing home about a piece of work I
have in mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Work?&#8221; she asked with some scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;A picture,&#8221; he explained amiably, &#8220;there&#8217;s a
lot of work in one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have little time for it here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, the inspiration for it came from
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen inspiration for nothing but deceit.
I refused to tell him anything whatever about
Alaska.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Langdon, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who else? I was left here alone an hour with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It did make a bit of a complication, but it&#8217;s all
adjusted now. I suppose I&#8217;ll have to tell all over
again about three-fingered Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is disgraceful,&#8221; she exploded, &#8220;I&#8217;ve a
good mind to confess the whole matter and have it
done with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it wouldn&#8217;t be done with even if you did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
that. It would be almost sure to reach Mr. Van
Patten&#8217;s ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be better if it did. It&#8217;s the first time
a Schuyler has not faced things squarely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but can&#8217;t we just as well face the
present situation squarely? We are working to
save a father&#8217;s mind&mdash;isn&#8217;t that a situation to
face squarely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re forced into the position of deceiving him
and not only him but a most estimable young man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, a most estimable young man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should die of shame if ever Carl discovered
our trickery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your brother would die of grief if ever <i>he</i>
discovered it. But he won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned upon her a bit nettled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Philomela,&#8221; he said, &#8220;now that we have
begun, we must play the game for all it&#8217;s worth.
That is another thing the Schuylers have always
done, haven&#8217;t they? You and I and the estimable
young man count for nothing in this. Do you think
I would play it for myself alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela looked a bit chagrined.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I suppose&mdash;I suppose we do
owe you a great debt.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_102.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">The soft grass had muffled his approach so that for a moment<br />
she was unaware that she was not alone.<br />

<span class="indentleft"><i>See page <a href="#Page_19">19</a></i></span></p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;You owe me nothing. I&#8217;m well repaid by my
inspirations and by a certain easing of my conscience
in a little family affair of my own. But
even without those things I should still be repaid.
And even if I were not repaid at all, I&#8217;d again
gladly undertake it. Only we must pull together,
Aunt Philomela, and we must stick it out to the
end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she trembled, &#8220;what is the end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>She was edging towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I spoke rather hastily,&#8221; she half apologized.</p>

<p>&#8220;So did I.&#8221; He smiled. &#8220;Often times we most
easily tell the truth that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She vanished. Barnes returned to his letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;I have my hands full.
I will write from time to time, but I&#8217;m so uncertain
in my movements that I can give no address.
You may always know that I am busy and in good
spirits.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Your son, Dick.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>The second letter was more easily accomplished.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>,&mdash;I&#8217;m head over heels in work

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>As he scrawled the addresses, he heard the tuning
of instruments in the sitting-room. He hastily
sealed the envelopes and hurried out. The sun was
just setting. The old brick house looked very mellow.</p>

<p>He walked to the tin mail-box and dropped in his
letters.</p>

<small>A LULLABY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>As it happened, it was this very night that Barnes
almost got a fair start upon his picture&mdash;almost
found the inspiration to do it, as he expressed it,
in a sort of gasp. One can no more foretell inspiration
than one can Opportunity. Both come
silently, unheralded, like angels and like angels stand
dimly but a moment at the elbow and then vanish.</p>

<p>Barnes was sitting with Mr. Van Patten in the
twilight. He had passed a pleasant and peaceful
hour with the old gentleman while the latter had
recalled a dozen little episodes of Joe&#8217;s childhood.
Barnes had nothing to do but remember.
Did Barnes remember that time he had been taken
down town and had his hair clipped? Did Barnes
remember that time when they visited the circus
and saw the elephant which he had thought wrong
end to? Did Barnes remember that glad day and
the other? He remembered them every one with no
more effort than to review his own boyhood with his
own father. It struck him as curious how much
alike they were.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>So with smile and chuckle and warm pressure of
the hand, the father himself became a boy again and
rambled on over many a tale of his own youth which
in turn was again marvelously like that of Barnes&#8217;
own youth. The mellow light hallowed the old
man&#8217;s white-bearded face; the homing birds twittered
sleepily without; the drowsy chirp of the
tree-toads and the warm chittering of the crickets
led him into a content like that of the valley of
shadows, though the sun still burned at the flamboyant
horizon line.</p>

<p>From time to time the father napped only to
awake if Barnes stirred a muscle. Then he would
feel about until he found the boy&#8217;s hand again and
settle back into a content born of utter trust. It
gave a sober turn to Barnes&#8217; thoughts.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Mr. Van Patten awoke
and called for Eleanor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell her I&#8217;d like to have her play a little to me,
Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glad of the relief, still gladder of this opportunity
to bring her again upon the canvas, Barnes joyfully
went below for her. The father had hit upon
just what was needed at this hour. Nothing but
music could harmonize the abrupt contrast of the
aggressive beauty outside and the somber spectacle
of this recumbent figure within. Never yet has there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
been a sect so austere as to bar the sensuous strains
of music even when serenest in the confidence of
their prayers. Though they may modulate it to
a hymn, though they may deaden it to a dirge,
though they may refine it to a mere chant, still they
cling to some wordless cadence to wing their prayerful
words. Music was needed here though an almost
religious peace prevailed.</p>

<p>Barnes found the girl seated beside her aunt in the
sitting-room. If anyone could play to such an hour,
to such a mood, he thought as he entered the room,
it was she. She carried him back to some of the
big unexplained moments of his life. One Sunday
night in London he had come upon a group of Welshmen
in Hyde Park who had gathered there to hold
in the big city&#8217;s vastest cathedral&mdash;the blue night
sky above the Marble Arch&mdash;their homely services.
Stubborn, angular men-shadows they were, grouped
in close, with the burdened women-shadows hovering
upon the outskirts. Without accompaniment
of anything but their beating hearts, they lifted
their sturdy voices in rough chorus&mdash;the gypsy
melodies going back to Druid times when so their
ancestors had stood half terrified by the unknown
power they invoked among the wiser trees. At
the sound of it, Barnes had felt himself a part of
all the centuries that had ever been and had risen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
a dignity of emotion which he had never felt since
save at this moment he stood upon the threshold
here to summon her to make music for the man
above.</p>

<p>Wherein lay the connection? He could not say,
save that it had something to do with her black hair;
something with the vagueness of her outline in the
shadows; something with the solemnity of that
common human love which gropes for companionship
with that common higher love. Emotions, like
religions, gain something in power by remaining
part mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father,&#8221; Barnes announced, &#8220;wishes you
to play for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I may listen, too?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish,&#8221; she replied without embarrassment,
&#8220;the things he likes are simple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The things I like are simple,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; murmured Aunt Philomela, a note
of fear in her voice. &#8220;They say it&#8217;s a bad sign when
the sick call for music.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say it was a good sign,&#8221; said Barnes.
&#8220;It proves them to be at peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t that a bad sign?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It depends upon your theory of life.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem normal, somehow,&#8221; she answered
with a little sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Aunty,&#8221; exclaimed the girl, &#8220;what has
come over you? You know Daddy often asks me
to play for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But at this time of day! It&#8217;s sort of creepy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve sat too long in the dark,&#8221; the girl declared,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a candle brought unless you wish
to join us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear no. I couldn&#8217;t stand it. He always
insists upon the dark and it is quite too&mdash;funereal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t get morbid, Aunty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten stooped and kissed the cameo
forehead and then rose and smoothed back the
silken gray hair a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that. It is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela did not finish. Whatever it was,
Barnes found himself feeling uncomfortable for a
moment. He knew that the old have certain senses
which mercifully are denied the young.</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten stepped into the next room and
returned with her &#8217;cello. He reached to take it from
her but she smiled a refusal and bore it up the stairs
by her side as lightly as though it had no weight.
It was as though she would trust it in no other hands
but her own. This promised well.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>&#8220;Come over here near me, Joe,&#8221; the father requested
as soon as they entered the room, &#8220;You
haven&#8217;t heard her since she was a little girl. She
plays wonderfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Barnes sat by the bedside while the daughter
took a position near the open window. It was now
quite dark. The twilight noises were hushed. One
could imagine oneself anywhere and Barnes chose
to go back to that still Spring night in Hyde Park
when he had looked up at the stars and heard, for
the first time, their music partly expressed.</p>

<p>There was no preliminary tuning to mar the first
perfect note she drew from the instrument. There
was scarcely a motion of the bow. It came deep-chested
as though summoned by the mere caressing
of the hand. She played first a serenade as
graceful and as full of color as the doves darting
about St. Marks; then a lighter Spanish air, and
then Rath&#8217;s &#8220;Leonore,&#8221; and then swung off into a
group of negro melodies which she herself had arranged.
But neither to the older man nor to the
younger man did the theme itself much matter&mdash;it
served only to wing their thoughts. The underlying
baritone voice of the &#8217;cello lent to Barnes&#8217;
imaginings eagle wings. He rode the winds with
a sure power that lifted him above the heads of the
huddled group of Welshmen&mdash;above the greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
huddled group called London, even to that brighter
upper region where men and cities and nations count
in the prospect not so much as the unpeopled mountains.
There he beat the ether with his strong new-fledged
wings and soared into some vague halcyon
future. So he rose and fell and rose again among
the clouds with the gentle undulations of the &#8217;cello
notes which swayed as rhythmically as heavy-leaved
tree limbs to a breeze. But never did he rise so
high that he was not conscious of the girl&#8217;s figure
in the dark. Always she was there; always she
was the inspiration. He realized that it was from
some such height as this that he must paint her.
It seemed as though he could do it here now&mdash;in
the dark. How would he do it? He smiled at his
conceit. He would paint a canvas with such wizardry
that to all those whose hearts were not in tune with
it, it should appear to be only a rich purple background
without figures. But to those who soared
in the upper ether it should, as they looked, take
form. First as their warm eyes rested upon it a
shadow should emerge and gently materialize into
the likeness of her. Then out of this her radiant
face should appear. Then her white arm holding
the bow, and then the scarcely perceptible outline
of the &#8217;cello and finally her black hair with gold in
it. And if one were big enough of heart, one would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
know that she was playing a barcarole and that another
was listening.</p>

<p>If only he had his paints&mdash;if only he had his
paints! One had only to hold one&#8217;s breath and&mdash;</p>

<p>As he straightened, the father stirred uneasily.
The girl had stopped and without speaking rested
her cheek against the strings. He had lost his moment.
His hand was unsteady when the old man
found it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are moved,&#8221; murmured the father. &#8220;No
wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Barnes below his breath, &#8220;it&#8217;s
no wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now she took her bow again. She began a
Southern lullaby&mdash;a lullaby with more of plaintive
mother love in it than even the masters have
ever caught. This time she added her voice&mdash;just
breathing the words so that it was scarcely
possible to tell whether it was she who was singing
or the untongued instrument itself.</p>

</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>As she began the chorus Barnes&#8217; own voice stole
in to join her, whereupon she improvised an alto
and left him to carry the air.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>

<p>When they had finished and while the &#8217;cello still
hummed on, she whispered,</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s asleep. That song always lulls him to
sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose and beckoned him to follow. He turned
to the old man. He was breathing regularly. He
loosened his fingers and crept across the room, closing
the door behind him. Miss Van Patten had
waited for him at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never forget this hour,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I played the things he enjoys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did the songs themselves matter?&#8221; he
burst out.</p>

<p>&#8220;You two must be much alike,&#8221; she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. If he went where you took me, he wouldn&#8217;t
be asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved down the stairs. He checked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we could sit here&mdash;a moment. It seems
wicked to go down into the light right off.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>She glanced up a bit startled. He could see her
eyes by the glow which came up from the sitting
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must go down right away,&#8221; she answered
quickly. &#8220;Aunt Philomela is waiting for
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dared not insist further. Before he reached
the bottom of the stairs he was sorry that he had
ventured that far. It was to the lady of his picture
he had spoken and she, this girl by his side, well she
was not the lady of his picture.</p>

<p>They found Aunt Philomela asleep by the candle.
Her hands were folded in her lap and her head was
bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; whispered Miss Van Patten. &#8220;The
music made her drowse too in spite of herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221; inquired Aunt Philomela
suddenly sitting up with the exaggerated look of
wide awakeness of one who endeavors thereby to
prove she has been wide awake all the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were asleep,&#8221; answered the girl,
stepping into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Asleep?&#8221; she answered tartly, &#8220;with that thing
buzzing in one&#8217;s ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite agree with you,&#8221; smiled Barnes. &#8220;The
&#8217;cello is the last thing in the world to inspire sleep
in the young.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>&#8220;It makes the most melancholic of sounds,&#8221; she
sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There I <i>cannot</i> agree with you,&#8221; returned
Barnes. &#8220;It sings most optimistically to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer my music in the daytime,&#8221; she affirmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps your taste runs to duets,&#8221; Barnes suggested.</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten had placed her instrument in
the corner and was now returning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think my niece plays very prettily with Carl,&#8221;
agreed Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>Barnes tried to reach the girl&#8217;s eyes. He
couldn&#8217;t. He frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard them tuning up,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;They
seemed to do that very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela arose with that decisiveness which
brooked no argument. It was disgracefully early
to retire and yet he knew she had that in mind. And
she would bear off the girl with her.</p>

<p>Which, with a curt good-night, she promptly did.</p>

<small>ON TROUT FISHING AND BOW-KNOTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>With what seemed to Barnes an inspired appetite,
Mr. Van Patten expressed a wish for brook-trout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor knows the stream,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And
perhaps you yourself would enjoy a little fishing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like nothing better,&#8221; Barnes responded
heartily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see if she will go this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly he began a still hunt for her and surprised
her from ambush as she was passing through
the living-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father wishes us to go fishing,&#8221; he informed
her bluntly lest she should disappear before
he had time to announce the glad news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, I have so much to do,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the duets on again this morning?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Philomela is at her accounts. She becomes
so confused when adding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sympathize with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In making up her column,&#8221; she explained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
&#8220;Aunt insists upon putting down what each item is
for; then she tries to add the items as well as the
figures. Like adding parsnips and butter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are very good when added in a frying-pan,&#8221;
he averred.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t add them in a column. She only
does it towards the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your father&#8217;s fish,&#8221; he reminded her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you would go alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I enjoy fishing,&#8221; he answered with a sinking
heart, &#8220;but that wouldn&#8217;t bring your father a fish.
I never have any luck. To-day we must be pot
hunters and work for results.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if Daddy wishes a trout he ought to have
one I suppose,&#8221; she thought aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly,&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll be ready in twenty minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I dig the bait while you&#8217;re gone?&#8221; he
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trout rise very well to flies,&#8221; she informed
him.</p>

<p>For which he was glad. He was not prudishly
sensitive about such things but still he would not
enjoy watching her impale a worm. It was a wriggling
function that he himself did not particularly
relish, less from humanitarian than &aelig;sthetic scruples.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>She returned dressed in a short khaki skirt of
hunting green, a wide-brimmed boy&#8217;s straw hat and
with a wicker fish-basket slung over her shoulder.
Her feet were encased in high oiled boots. She
stepped to the closet and brought out two rod cases,
a book of flies, and two reels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any choice of weight?&#8221; she asked
holding out both rods.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better give me the heavier one,&#8221; he suggested
off hand.</p>

<p>The most of his fishing had been done from a
flat boat with a bamboo pole. Still he did not intend
to admit to her such unsportsmanlike conduct. He
knew nothing of fly fishing but he was determined
to observe her closely and follow her example in
every detail. When in college he had gone South
with some friends for a week of bird shooting and
had acquitted himself creditably by this method,
though he had never before held a gun. In the
same way, by his quickness and determination, he
had ridden fifteen miles the first time he was ever
upon a horse.</p>

<p>They left the house without seeing Aunt Philomela,
though as he went down the path Barnes felt
her eyes burning into his back. They crossed the
road and pushed through the fields to the meadow-brook.
They followed the banks for the matter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
half a mile before she finally stopped to put together
the poles.</p>

<p>She glanced at the sky, at the water, and then
ran her pink finger tips over the gorgeous medley of
brightly-feathered flies. She selected one for herself
and handed the book to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying a Silver Moth,&#8221; she announced.</p>

<p>It took him longer to decide because there were
no more Silver Moths, but he finally drew out a
gay scarlet fly with a body of mottled brown. Its
coloring was as daintily bright as that of a butterfly.
He went upon the simple theory that if <i>he</i> were
a trout it would be with some such fastidious temptation
that he himself would coquet. He adjusted
it slowly with one eye upon her.</p>

<p>She poised herself upon the edge of the bank with
her figure erect, alert, every fine line pulsating with
life. With a full, free arm movement she swung
the lithe pole back, then forward. The Silver Moth
circled her head, paused a moment ten yards behind
her, and then following the swishing line darted
straight out over the stream, swift as a homing bee
and kissed the water with scarcely a ripple. She
drew it back and this time sent it even farther.
Then once again, until the long line reached almost
to the opposite bank.</p>

<p>What a picture that would make! Diana with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
her hounds was not half the subject. What gentle
strength there was in every movement&mdash;what
rhythm, and above the beautiful body, what a head.
The wonder of those features was that they lived
up to any part you wished to assume for them. A
short while ago they had consistently upheld the
traditions of Venice; still later they had blended
into dusk dreams; now they expressed the elemental
beauty of the Indian.</p>

<p>As the Silver Moth rippled against the current,
she turned to see what he was about. She saw and
turned back again to the Silver Moth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What fly are you using?&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;A butterfly,&#8221; he answered with an intake of
breath.</p>

<p>Then he roused himself and contrived to get the
bit of feather into the water, though he was glad
she did not observe the process.</p>

<p>He offered up a silent invocation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, trout, king of all your fellows come to my
hook and I will hallow your death with prayers of
thanksgiving. Set me well before her eyes and
I vow never to disturb your finny kingdom again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had he only anticipated such an emergency as
this he would have given over the hours he had
wasted so idly in dreams all these years, to the perfecting
himself in the art of casting a fly. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
were those days in London; he saw now that he
could have used the Thames to much better advantage
than in merely gazing at its dull fogs; there
was the Seine, and he had stood lazily upon its
banks for hours content in watching the little barges
puff up and down.</p>

<p>He felt a ferocious tug at his line. Before he
recovered from his surprise a speckled red body
flung itself from the water and, striking it again in
a churning splash, cut an arrow-like course down
stream. He felt as though the line were knotted
about his heart. He knew well enough that now the
thing to do was to keep the line taut.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any cost,&#8221; he muttered grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hooked him!&#8221; he heard her voice.</p>

<p>That was not quite accurate; the trout had
hooked himself. But if there was any grace in
the strong will of a man he would keep him
hooked.</p>

<p>She withdrew her line to give him plenty of
room and to watch him. There are few things
a man cannot do if the right woman is watching him.
He fought the big trout back and forth, anticipating
by instinct every sudden turn, every inshore
dart, every upstream flash. The line did not slacken
a quarter of an inch. Foot by foot he forced
the speckled beauty towards the bank. He was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
even deceived when for a second the fish lay passive
a second and then darted towards the shelter of a
group of bowlders. He checked him within the
very shadow of this hiding-place. Then inch by
inch he reeled again, dragging him in relentlessly
towards his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;We should have brought
the landing-net. But we don&#8217;t often have use for
it in these waters.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew the line still closer towards his itching
fingers. He grasped it. He gave it a tug and in
another second had tossed upon the grass the largest
trout ever taken from Schuyler brook.</p>

<p>She clapped her hands in applause.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a beauty,&#8221; she cried enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty fair,&#8221; he confessed modestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you handled him so well!&#8221; she praised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think you captured him with a Scarlet
Beauty. I have never been able to get a rise with
that fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On a bright day,&#8221; he replied sagely, &#8220;and in
slow waters, they seem to work very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your judgment was sound,&#8221; she admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the judgment of the gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the gods are certainly with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are,&#8221; he confessed brazenly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;I think I shall change my fly,&#8221; she determined.
&#8220;What should you advise?&#8221;</p>

<p>He picked out for her a pretty tasseled thing
which contained a touch of crimson such as was on
his.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d try this,&#8221; he counseled. &#8220;And I shall
stand by and see how it works.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re going to fish too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ve discharged my filial duties. Your
father has his trout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we must get one for Aunt Philomela.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must refrain. I&#8217;m under certain obligations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Obligations?&#8221; she questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;To my prize. To the king,&#8221; he answered waving
his hand airily towards the gasping fish.</p>

<p>Acting upon this, he, to her wonder, packed up
his rod, placed his trout in the basket, and took a
comfortable seat a little to the right of her.</p>

<p>Truly the gods were with him. Had they not
listened to his invocation? Otherwise he must
have stood upon the bank and given over his whole
thought to the matter of casting a bit of feather
upon the waters. He could have studied the sky
only as it was reflected in the stream, and only as
much of her as he could catch from the corner of
his eye. And always there would have been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
danger of an entangling alliance between his hook
and her gown with the consequent embarrassment of
showing ill before her. He must have been born
under Pisces.</p>

<p>Again and again she cast her line for Aunt
Philomela without success. But what Aunt Philomela
lost, he gained. He won a new memory of
her at every strong-limbed movement. He prayed
for failure. Surely, he thought, that estimable
lady would cheerfully surrender the mere item
of a delectable morsel or two for such pictures as
these.</p>

<p>But Miss Van Patten herself did not relish the
position as much as she might. She was conscious
of being watched and this, unless a girl be vain, is
not pleasant no matter how delicately the watching
is done. So she slowly reeled in her line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, you don&#8217;t mean to deprive Aunt Philomela
of her fish?&#8221; he hastened to protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she would rather have me finish her accounts,&#8221;
she affirmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we tried a few moments longer&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have noticed,&#8221; she declared, continuing to
reel in her line, &#8220;that when at the beginning you
land a big fish, the little fishes cease to bite.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt guilty, as though he had been the means
of depriving her of her sport. As she left the bank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
he took her pole and dismembered it for her, prolonging
the task as long as possible. He wished
now that he had not caught his fish so soon. The
ideal way to fish with her, he thought, would be to
have a trout concealed in one&#8217;s pocket and so with
no responsibility dabble with the fly until the opportune
moment for going home arrived and then
deftly hook the fish upon the line and produce it.
The pity of life was that no sooner had one prettily
solved some problem by experience than the opportunity
for using it was gone. It might well be that
Mr. Van Patten would never have again so convenient
a taste for trout.</p>

<p>Barnes was in hope that perhaps she might seat
herself, if he were long enough about this business of
packing up the rods, but she didn&#8217;t. She watched
him with interest but with no other thought in mind
than returning to the house as soon as he was ready.
So with a little sigh, he finally tied the cloth
case at the top in a knot that no human being could
ever separate without the use of a knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never can untie that,&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;All you have to do,&#8221; he assured her with honest
conviction, &#8220;is to pull the loop string.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know how to make a real bow-knot?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a bow-knot?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;A bow-knot has two loops and comes untied,&#8221;
she informed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought the object of a knot was to remain
tied. Mine have at least that advantage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you want them to untie sometime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cut mine when you wish to undo them,&#8221;
he explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is both wasteful and untidy. I will show
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was a lesson worth learning. He handed her
the rod. She pulled gingerly at the string but only
succeeded in fixing the knot more firmly than ever.
She removed a pin from her hat and began to pick.
It was a long process but it gave him time to admire
the nimbleness of her fingers. The knot became
loosened only too soon.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Now you take it so
and you do like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was tied in the snap of a finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, when you pull one end of either string,
it becomes unfastened.&#8221;</p>

<p>She demonstrated. He took the rod and tried
the same process clumsily. She came nearer and
guided his fingers. He caught the perfume of her
hair. It was like dying clover. He felt the electric
thrill of her fingers. It only made him the
clumsier.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>She gave up in despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will never learn,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can always try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must practice by yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done so for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you must never tie any but
your own things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he reflected, &#8220;anything that I wish to
tie hard, I must first own.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he didn&#8217;t own the rod, so she tied that herself.
As they rose to go Carl approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he called, &#8220;fishing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Barnes, &#8220;hunting.&#8221;</p>

<small>ON ADVENTURING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Carl was asked to supper and Mr. Van Patten
insisted that the prize should be cooked for the
guest. The king trout was avenged for his fate.
Yet there could be no denying that he made a
pretty dish. Through the crackling skin, thin as
gold-leaf, the scarlet speckles still showed, so that,
garnished with parsley as he was, he looked as
content upon the platter as though he were still
nosing through water-cress in his native element.</p>

<p>Carl was placed opposite Miss Van Patten, and
Barnes was thus left to face Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust your accounts balanced,&#8221; he ventured
to inquire of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Within a peck of potatoes,&#8221; answered Aunt
Philomela indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I should say was doing very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For an artist, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Accounts are an awful bother,&#8221; Carl chipped in.</p>

<p>&#8220;We waste so much time,&#8221; said Barnes. &#8220;We
waste so much time in details. When all is said
and done what is a peck of potatoes?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>&#8220;Never cared for potatoes,&#8221; vouchsafed Carl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where would our accounts be if we permitted
such slipshod methods as yours?&#8221; Aunt Philomela
challenged Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, they&#8217;d be always as they are,&#8221; he replied
lightly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed that if you&#8217;ll allow
it, your creditors do all the figuring for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For themselves rather,&#8221; snapped Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;It comes to the same in the end,&#8221; he opined.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even so, it&#8217;s just as well to retard the process.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sooner they get it, the less they trouble
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then where would you be?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be in the hole,&#8221; nodded Carl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, you&#8217;d be just where you were to start
with,&#8221; Barnes affirmed grandly. &#8220;Creditors can&#8217;t
disturb <i>you</i>. They can only get your money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be all very well for an artist,&#8221; Aunt
Philomela answered darkly, as though at best
artists were but jail-birds.</p>

<p>Carl was devouring his portion of the trout with
evident relish.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a great fisherman, Joe,&#8221; he complimented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes turned back to Aunt Philomela.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>&#8220;Artists are human,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;perhaps
a little more human than other humans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten put in a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why artists are always placed in a
class by themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; agreed Barnes. &#8220;The distinction
is a purely arbitrary one. If there is any
class, it belongs to the others&mdash;to the green-grocer
and his peck of potatoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an artist then?&#8221; inquired Carl in surprise.</p>

<p>Barnes himself was a bit surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;All honest men are artists,&#8221; he replied vaguely.</p>

<p>&#8220;And all honest men keep their accounts,&#8221; stuck
in Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they have any to keep. I doubt if strictly
honest men have any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a Socialist?&#8221; inquired Carl.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I keep an account with myself. If I
don&#8217;t use figures, why I lie awake longer at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t care whether you come out right or
not,&#8221; snapped Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your true artist cares more than anyone else
in the world how he comes out,&#8221; he answered
soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the potatoes&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The potatoes. When all is said and done what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
is a peck of potatoes? I am like Mr. Langdon, I
don&#8217;t care for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you aren&#8217;t like me about trout. You don&#8217;t
seem to care for trout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I enjoy catching them at least. Perhaps I&#8217;m
like my sister in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to Miss Van Patten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been hopelessly
beaten in my own waters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you had plenty of sport in Alaska,&#8221;
broke in Carl.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Alaska?&#8221; answered Barnes absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;With four fingered William,&#8221; Aunt Philomela
hastily reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Polar bear and&mdash;such things?&#8221; persisted
Carl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. Polar bear and such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Barnes stubbornly
refused to expound. Miss Van Patten came to the
rescue. She asked Carl about the new song he was
composing. That answered through the dessert,
but with the cheese and coffee Carl turned once
more upon Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you had a rough time of it where you
came from. Nothing like this, was it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;Where I came from&mdash;no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Snow everywhere I suppose. Nothing green?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the house where I lived, you couldn&#8217;t see
a sprig of green,&#8221; Barnes answered truthfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove, it must be a desolate country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ghastly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And everyone grubbing for gold, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every mother&#8217;s son doing nothing else. Night
and day; day and night. It&#8217;s all they think of&mdash;where
I came from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must be depressing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s killing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela was following every word breathlessly.
The girl, too, held herself ready to rush into
the breach should there be need.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t like it then?&#8221; asked Carl.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. That&#8217;s why I left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose a lot of men don&#8217;t get much out of it
even after putting up with all the hardships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. I know a man who has cleaned up
two million dollars without getting anything out of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove. A friend of yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A sort of friend,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>He referred to his father. What <i>had</i> he got
out of it? He was tied hand and foot in a gingerbread
apartment house. His two million had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
never given him an hour like that by the trout-brook.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; suggested Carl, &#8220;it&#8217;s the spell that
makes them stand it&mdash;a sort of mountain Lorelei.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes started.</p>

<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t make a bad theme for an
opera,&#8221; mused Carl.</p>

<p>Barnes turned to him with renewed interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever done anything in that line?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>A new light came into Langdon&#8217;s face at the
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hope to?&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon flushed boyishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This summer has made me hope,&#8221; he answered
quietly.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela rose. Out of a full heart Barnes
silently thanked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you two will practice to-night?&#8221; she
asked her niece.</p>

<p>Barnes waited for the answer. Miss Van Patten
turned to Carl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but I promised Dr.
Merriweather to play to him after supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes no longer begrudged him the brook-trout.
When shortly after Carl took his departure Barnes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
felt actually glad that he had been the humble
means of furnishing him so good a supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go out and see the after-glow,&#8221; he suggested
as standing on the door step with Miss Van
Patten, he saw Carl turn the corner, by the letter-box.</p>

<p>She was upon the point of hesitating when he led
the way in so determined a manner that after
throwing a shawl about her shoulders, she followed.
He trampled a trail through the knee-deep grass to
the summit in the rear of the house. Below them
lay a sweep of undulating hills unbroken to the
horizon line.</p>

<p>At the edge of the world a mass of clouds impersonated
the Alps&mdash;towering to an impressive
height above the purple hills. Their whiteness was
tinted with pink and one of them burned with a
ghostly fire. Above these, in flat strips, lay ribbons
of old-rose and greenish-yellow, while still higher
the sky was a golden haze. For a moment they
stared in silence at the gorgeous picture. Then he
declared,</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks like Alaska.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard for me to realize that you haven&#8217;t
really been in Alaska,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You make it all
so vivid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to let my proxy attend to the actuality,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
he answered, &#8220;but I thank him for transferring
his dreams to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid Joe never dreamed very beautifully.
The dreams are all your own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have dreamed some,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;or
he wouldn&#8217;t have undertaken the journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He dreamed of gold, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a dream is always a dream. There&#8217;s
some good in a man who will go adventuring even
for gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the object of the quest makes some difference,&#8221;
she insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly. Though not as much as you
would think. It&#8217;s the way a man handles the
obstacles to his quest that counts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then for that matter a man might go adventuring
in his own house,&#8221; she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or along a country road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;there are obstacles
everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a dull world without them. Your
greatest adventurer after all is a child. De Soto
never ran the gauntlet of half the thrilling hazards
that confront an infant in his toddling course
from the nursery to the garden-gate. And if the
gate is a-swing and he is successful in reaching
the saffron road, he has before him an open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
field that might well make Pizarro pause and
gasp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You almost tempt one to start upon a quest,&#8221;
she laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve probably already started,&#8221; he affirmed.
&#8220;Everyone starts as soon as he finds his feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the joy of it lies in the consciousness of it,&#8221;
she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment. Their eyes met at
a focus point in the fiery clouds at the edge of the
earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next to children, lovers are your true adventurers,&#8221;
he declared.</p>

<p>She offered no opinion upon this, but turned her
head a little to the right, away from him. The
sunset appeared in her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your true lover,&#8221; he went on, pursuing his
own fancy, &#8220;when footing the soft grass of a country
lane is, in reality, blazing a trail through the
tangled everglades of Florida. He is in search
of the Fountain of Youth. He is on a voyage
of discovery as momentous as that of Columbus
for he, too, is after a new world. Your
lover, even at home, is ever challenging the
rugged heights of Alaska in search of hidden
gold.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>She kept her eyes fixed upon the burning West.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the dangers he faces?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My soul, the dangers!&#8221; exclaimed Barnes.
&#8220;The dangers are innumerable and terrifying. If
he stumbles on so much as a phrase, he is plunged
into a chasm of despair a mile deep. On every
side he is confronted by icy glaciers of reserve that
half hide the stars in his firmament. If he swerve
one whit from the straight path, he is involved in
a tangle of misunderstandings. Hostile Indians
of the tribe Jaloux attack him at every point. If
he move too fast, he is torn to shreds by rebuking
thorns; if he go too slow, he perishes and no one
mourns. Fever and thirst and heart-hunger are
his. In ambush lie shaggy bears of prejudices,
wild hyenas of relatives, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; she laughed uneasily, &#8220;you quite
frighten one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This falling in love is no small matter,&#8221; he
avowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would not think then that so many men
would venture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would not think that so many men would
go to sea in boats; you would not think that so
many men would go to wars; you would not think
that so many men would try to paint.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sky was like a burnished gold floor; was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
like the yellow sand that lies below Indian waters.
The world looked marvelously serene to her. And
yet she felt as though the West were calling her.
It was as though a soft hand had suddenly been put
within hers and were tenderly drawing her towards
the sunset. When she turned back to the house,
it was as though she were turning away from something.
The brick house looming before her in the
dusk gave less a promise of shelter than of restriction.
The walls which had always given her a
peaceful sense of security, now appeared more like
those of a retaining castle. It is an odd illusion
which can turn a fortress into a prison. It is
equaled only by that which turns a prison into a
fortress.</p>

<p>It is small wonder that it leaves a maiden
thoughtful. It is small wonder that so slight a
matter as the closing of an old Dutch door behind
her, is enough to bring her heart up into her throat.</p>

<small>STRATEGY AND GEOGRAPHY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Barnes&#8217; position in the library was a strategic
one. It gave him an excuse for not venturing out
on so fair a morning, after his usual hour with Mr.
Van Patten; it saved him from the necessity of
lounging in the sitting-room and so revealing too
obviously his object in remaining indoors; and it
afforded him a point of vantage to intercept Miss
Van Patten from time to time as she passed up
and downstairs on her important housewifely missions.
Incidentally it gave him time to muse and
still more incidentally to acquire a variety of statistics
which he hoped to use this evening as defense
guns in the assault he anticipated from Dr. Merriweather
on his none too impregnable position. For
Aunt Philomela had astounded them both by announcing
that she had asked the doctor to dinner
that evening. So far, Barnes had been successful
in evading the man, for from all he had heard he
would find it no easy matter to hoodwink this big-hearted
country doctor.</p>

<p>He made his first sortie as Miss Van Patten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
passed the door on her way with orders to the cook.
She wore a small white apron as finely embroidered
as a muslin kerchief. In her hand she held a pad
and pencil. Any one could see with half a glance
that she had no time to waste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Eleanor,&#8221; he exclaimed, rushing out.</p>

<p>At sound of her name she grew confused and
stopped as short as though an emergency brake had
been applied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he stammered, not realizing
until then the impetuosity of his attack. &#8220;I
beg your pardon, but Alaska contains five hundred
and eighty-six thousand square miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;d better write it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>She scribbled it on the top of her pad and later
amazed the cook by ordering five hundred and
eighty-six thousand pounds of roast.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a surprising fact, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>It certainly had surprised her if that is what he
meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know Alaska was so large,&#8221; she admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I. But it is. You can see it here on the
map.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hurried back to the map and standing over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
it pointed melodramatically in such a way that one
could not help but examine unless one wished to
appear rude.</p>

<p>&#8220;It goes from here to here and here to here,&#8221; he
explained as she came nearer. &#8220;It was bought from
Russia for seven million, two hundred dollars. The
deal proved that the nation had become essentially
Yankee. I think some of my ancestors must have
been mixed up in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father is a business man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The apotheosis of a business man. He reckons
his age in fiscal years. Business to his life is what
the cook-stove is to the kitchen; it warms and feeds
him. Take it away and the world would contain
nothing but useless pots and kettles and a few raw
materials. The only concession he makes to Art is
to put a scroll upon the cook-stove door. It was
from that scroll that I received my own humble
inclination towards Art.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid your father would think you wasting
your time here,&#8221; she said anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father thinks I waste all my time,&#8221; he assured
her. &#8220;But that is because he doesn&#8217;t know.
I rather think he would give me credit for doing a
little better than usual at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it were possible to return to him your
kindness to my father.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he faltered, &#8220;the opportunity will
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it would,&#8221; she cried eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know if it does,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to his. Then she lowered
them. For a fraction of a second she felt as she had
when the Dutch door closed upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to marvel,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;how
often the little incidents of life turn out to be the big
ones. Every decision we make is like drawing at
straws held in the hand of Fate. The ends are all
even and we can&#8217;t tell until afterwards&mdash;years
afterwards, perhaps&mdash;whether we have drawn the
short straw or the long straw.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without at all thinking what she was about, she
wrote upon her pad, &#8220;Long straw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we draw,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;every minute
of our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>While her eyes were lowered upon the paper (she
was working a scroll about the sentence) he leaned
forward a little. Three days ago Fate had held out
to him two straws; one was the road to the next
village, the other was the road to this house. He
had drawn, he thought, the short one, but was it
so? Was it so?</p>

<p>&#8220;You make life seem such a breathless affair,&#8221;
she was saying.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;It is such a wonderful affair,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It had always seemed to me here rather humdrum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sunsets,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;the sunsets are
such nesting-places of fancies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So is everywhere; so is this old library.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the kitchen,&#8221; she put in quickly, &#8220;is a
place of stern realities. I must go at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>No one could leave more abruptly when her
mind was upon it. Before he had gathered his wits
together she had gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; he determined with a sigh, &#8220;the curse
of the cook-stove. The Acme has worked its spell
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the map before him, he settled himself to
explore more in detail this new country which lay
immediately before him. In this the map itself
did not help him except to afford a convenient
resting-place for his elbows.</p>

<p>It was clear to him now that he had inadvertently
stumbled upon the center of the universe. It was
rather odd that geographers had neglected to point
out so significant a feature. To the north lay the
North, to the south lay the South, to the east the
East, to the west the West. Start in any direction,
continue in a straight line, and one would come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
back here. It was a demonstrable fact. He had
no doubt that even if one pursued a circuitous and
zigzag path, the result would be the same. One
could no more escape it than can the compass the
magnetic north. Had he himself not reached this
point over that devious winding course which started
at his cradle?</p>

<p>He heard her footsteps and charged his guns with
another fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he announced as she approached
the library door on her way back upstairs, &#8220;do you
know that Alaska is approximately as large as all
the United States east of the Mississippi river, if
we subtract the areas of Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Mississippi, North Carolina, and West Virginia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; she observed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he reflected, &#8220;that if you subtracted
some more, it would then be twice as large as
something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose they wish to make it look as large as
they can,&#8221; she remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see it on the map,&#8221; he urged.</p>

<p>He crossed the room to the atlas and she had
nothing to do again but follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that pink space,&#8221; he announced as grandly
as though he owned it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How interesting,&#8221; she murmured.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>&#8220;There are a great many facts in a geography,&#8221;
he declared, &#8220;which aren&#8217;t generally known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are certainly a great many facts about
Alaska which even geographers don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Also about this place. Geographers are very
ignorant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t expect to find Chester on the
map.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I <i>did</i> find it,&#8221; he avowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did? May I see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Take my place here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She seated herself in his chair and leaned forward
expectantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he instructed, &#8220;rest your elbows on the
atlas and close your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she exclaimed in confusion at having
fallen into his trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;One understands geography a great deal better
with you in the room,&#8221; he confessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I shouldn&#8217;t be in the room,&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;I was on my way to Aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose at once, but this time he covered her
retreat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you written down what I just told you?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I shall write down any more,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
answered, remembering the mistake she had made
to the cook.</p>

<p>She was almost as tall as he and yet he could
not see her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt is waiting for me,&#8221; she explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a safe statement to make at any time,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is very important; I am to see about
the dusting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you can find any dust in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is necessary to dust just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as one prays when there isn&#8217;t anything
to pray about,&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or talks when there isn&#8217;t anything to talk
about,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>Whereupon he promptly stood aside and allowed
her to pass.</p>

<p>At the door she turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; she apologized. &#8220;I&#8217;d
stay if&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He moved towards her. She ran upstairs.</p>

<p>It seemed an eternity before she appeared again.
He hurried to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alaska has a population of thirty-five thousand
white people,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;There are a lot
of us up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was armed with a feather duster.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;I am to do the library,&#8221; she made the much
more significant announcement. &#8220;The servants are
all busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing like giving the servants a
great deal of work,&#8221; he declared enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;While I&#8217;m doing this,&#8221; she remarked, &#8220;you
may instruct me about Alaska.&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved at once upon the book-case. Her
arms were guarded by sleeve-protectors of a pink
and white apple-blossom design.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t think,&#8221; he made a beginning, &#8220;that
gold is the only interest there. In the fiscal year of
1908 the merchandise shipments alone amounted to
roughly twenty-six million, eight hundred and seventy-five
thousand, three hundred and seventy-three
dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is a fiscal year?&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sorriest of all years; the twelve month
space between dollar marks. I don&#8217;t remember that
I ever had one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Aunt Philomela must have them. I
forgot to tell you that her accounts came out right,
in the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no doubt they would,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He watched her a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder just what the economic value of stirring
up dust is,&#8221; he mused.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>She turned upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want your library to look as though
you never used it, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One might use a library,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;without
ever disturbing the books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a convenient place to practice in,&#8221; she
admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh. Are you to practice your duets to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wrote Carl that I should be too busy. And he
wished to play me his new song.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At first I should have said it was impossible for
him to write a song, but now&mdash;I think I see how
he does it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a great deal of talent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I liked the way his eyes lighted up at thought
of a possible opera,&#8221; he admitted frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says he can&#8217;t think of you as a business
man,&#8221; she laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;he says&mdash;you inspire
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But say&mdash;that&#8217;s odd. I wonder how <i>I</i> inspire
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says you make him see the tragedy of those
men up North. He says&mdash;&#8221; she hesitated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said he thought you must have had some big
tragedy in your own life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what nature?&#8221; he inquired with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some big disappointment.&#8221;</p>

<p>She appeared confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what nature?&#8221; he persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I shouldn&#8217;t have told you. I don&#8217;t suppose
I ought.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some disappointment in love?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he&#8217;s wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she asked indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely. It may be in store for me, but it
hasn&#8217;t come yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t any of us tell what is in store for us,&#8221;
she said quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It might be in store for him, too, mightn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For Carl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; he said soberly. &#8220;I think that
must be the biggest possible tragedy in anyone&#8217;s
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it isn&#8217;t very safe to go adventuring, is it?&#8221;
she suggested.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;Safe? No. But it isn&#8217;t much of a man who
won&#8217;t&mdash;for all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have finished my dusting,&#8221; she announced,
suddenly moving towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to neglect
those books in the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said they didn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have changed my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow I can&#8217;t waste any more time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waste? Waste?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>But she had gone.</p>

<small>A SURPRISE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Promptly at seven the candles were lighted upon
the dinner-table where they burned in sacrificial
splendor in the midst of an offering fit for Ceres.
At seven one, Aunt Philomela swept in gowned in
purple silk, resplendent in the family jewels; at
seven five Miss Van Patten appeared and put the
family jewels to shame. She was in something as
light as mist. It fell from her neck and hung like
spray about her ankles. At seven ten the doctor&#8217;s
gig drove up and a hearty &#8220;Whoa&#8221; announced the
doctor himself like a bugle blast. At seven fifteen,
the preliminary embarrassment of the introduction
was over and Barnes&#8217; back smarting under the
gruff greeting. At seven twenty the doctor returned
from a brief visit upstairs and John produced
himself in the majesty of full regalia.</p>

<p>It was not until the soup was served that Barnes
found himself in a position to size up the genial
enemy. Among other reasons he was too elated over
the necessity that had forced Aunt Philomela to
seat him opposite her niece. Barnes saw a heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
man of sixty with a round tanned face, and hands
of remarkable beauty. They were tender hands
backed by arms that might have been those of a
Flemish warrior. In a dozen ways the bluff doctor
made him think of those who fought in Flanders
and secured immortality, not so much by their
deeds, strangely enough, as by the canvases of those
who depicted them. The burly physician might
have been the result of some subtle blending of the
poet artist and his warrior model; of the brush and
the sword. Give him a rolling hat with a feather
in it, and he could take his place beside Porthos;
put a brush in his hand and he would have passed
for Rembrandt. At the sick bed of children the
women gave over, unquestioning, the joy of their
travail to those hands&mdash;recognizing them as even
more tender than their own.</p>

<p>It took but a glance to see what he must mean to
the country-side. No ice-laden wind which ever
blew would be strong enough to stand between him
and a cry of pain or the moan of a fevered soul. It
was enough if he himself came; it did not so much
matter whether he brought his vials or no.</p>

<p>Barnes found the situation more disconcerting
than he had anticipated. His self-confidence deserted
him. He had no heart to play upon this
big man&#8217;s credulity. Rather would he take him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
into his confidence; rather would he speak fairly
to those blue eyes resting in their nest of wrinkles.
Here was a man used to seeing the unshrouded
souls of his fellows. He was doctor, priest, and
lawyer, and when these three get together in one
man there is a great dropping off of cloaking rags.
Such a man must see terrible things; at times
beautiful things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy,&#8221; exclaimed the doctor, &#8220;you&#8217;ve done
more for your father in three days than I&#8217;ve been
able to do in three months. You ought to have
come a year ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d known what I now know I <i>would</i> have
come,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela glanced up sharply. But she
was not in her usual spirit. Her heart was in her
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a man gets old he clings to his own,&#8221;
declared the doctor. &#8220;It is as natural as for
youth to reach for the new.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any age,&#8221; opined Aunt Philomela, &#8220;there
is nothing like one&#8217;s own flesh and blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so,&#8221; objected the doctor, &#8220;if my son
didn&#8217;t stand by his sweetheart against me I&#8217;d
disown him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes felt his heart warming towards this
man at once.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s Carl,&#8221; pursued the doctor with a wink
at Eleanor, &#8220;he&#8217;s reaching out&mdash;reaching out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes turned to his soup.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is different,&#8221; answered Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>The doctor swallowed his soup red hot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy,&#8221; he broke out, &#8220;you have been where I
would go if I were thirty years younger. I&#8217;ve
too many children here to look after or I might
go now. Tell me about the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes glanced up. John had stepped into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You refer to Alaska?&#8221; he asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alaska,&#8221; answered the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never been there in my life,&#8221; was
Barnes&#8217; astounding reply.</p>

<p>For a moment there was that stillness which
presages the hurricane; a hush of such intensity
that it seemed as though the inanimate objects
participated&mdash;a silence so close as to be stifling.
Then Aunt Philomela dropped her spoon. The
girl started. The doctor&#8217;s brows contracted.
Barnes sipped his soup.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I did not understand you,&#8221; hazarded
Dr. Merriweather.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said I have never been in Alaska in my
life,&#8221; Barnes repeated in as matter of fact a tone
as he might have commented on the weather.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>The doctor turned to Miss Schuyler. The latter
could not have pronounced her own name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; inquired the doctor, &#8220;am I to understand
that you&#8217;re an impostor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing else,&#8221; admitted Barnes, &#8220;but,&#8221; he
added, anxiously glancing towards the buttery,
&#8220;you mustn&#8217;t let the servants know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;re not even Mr. Van Patten&#8217;s
son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no relation whatever,&#8221; confessed Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; gasped Aunt Philomela weakly.</p>

<p>The girl turned and smiled upon her. After
the first shock, she strangely enough was the only
composed one of the group. She was not only
composed but elated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me explain,&#8221; begged Barnes, facing the
doctor squarely. &#8220;After all, it&#8217;s a simple ruse;
the boy Joe would not come, and so to save Mr.
Van Patten from the shock of this news, I volunteered.
The deceit has worked perfectly; he suspects
nothing, and is, as you saw, a happy man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; muttered the doctor, &#8220;so that explains
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face began to brighten and continued until
it had expanded into a broad grin. With this expression
he again confronted Aunt Philomela,
whose cheeks had turned a fiery red.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>&#8220;Aunty Schuyler,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
think it was in you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that it&mdash;it was contemptible, but I&mdash;I
couldn&#8217;t help it,&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Contemptible!&#8221; he exploded. &#8220;It&#8217;s great!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to Barnes and stretched out his big
arm across the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy, your hand upon it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes seized the hand, and that firm grip, if
nothing else, made it seem all worth while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Philomela&mdash;&#8221; began Barnes, still anxious
to absolve Miss Schuyler.</p>

<p>But the doctor interrupted him with a loud
laugh. He threw back his head and laughed as
he had not laughed in twenty years.</p>

<p>&#8220;She told me a yarn that was pretty hard to
swallow,&#8221; he roared, &#8220;but, Lord, it was a good
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; she pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;She told me about Billy who had lost four
fingers, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Le voil&agrave;,&#8221; interrupted Barnes, swinging upon
Aunt Philomela, &#8220;I warned you to be accurate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten reached under the table and
found Aunt Philomela&#8217;s trembling hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you made it all up as you went along?&#8221;
demanded the doctor, the tears starting in his eyes.
&#8220;You did it off hand?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; broke in Barnes. &#8220;Truly she must be
exonerated. She only repeated what I told her.
She was quite forced into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t spoil it,&#8221; pleaded the doctor, waving
him back. &#8220;Don&#8217;t take her laurels! I&#8217;ve told
her often enough that the only thing she lacked
was imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this moment John entered, and Barnes
raised a warning finger to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let John know. It might get upstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mum&#8217;s the word,&#8221; agreed the doctor, trying
hard to stifle his chuckles.</p>

<p>He whispered across the table,</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunty Schuyler&mdash;after dinner&mdash;more!
More!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Barnes saw that it was high time to check
the merriment. The little old lady looked to be
upon the point of leaving. She took the situation
far too seriously. So he deftly turned the doctor
away from the subject to a theme he had long since
discovered to be a vital one in the country,&mdash;the
rights of automobiles on country roads.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had my way,&#8221; the doctor exploded, rising
to the bait at once, &#8220;I&#8217;d fine &#8217;em a hundred dollars
for going over four miles an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But in your profession you find them useful?&#8221;
inquired Barnes, though he knew from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
way the doctor had shouted &#8220;Whoa&#8221; as he entered
the yard that he was too loyal to his horse
to admit such slander.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! D&#8217;ye think I&#8217;d risk my patient&#8217;s life
to say nothing of my own in one of the things?
When I start I want to be sure of getting there.
What d&#8217;ye think I&#8217;d have done last night at Mrs.
Van Dusen&#8217;s with only a minute to spare?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela glanced up with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;A boy,&#8221; he informed her.</p>

<p>Her eyes warmed.</p>

<p>Barnes drew him on further to tell of some of
the cases in the neighborhood in which Aunt Philomela
was interested. This turned out to be an
inexhaustible theme and revealed the fact that in
the work of relief organization Aunt Philomela
was the doctor&#8217;s good right arm. The two of them
were evidently a self-appointed board of charities
for the village. Aunt Philomela lost herself in the
discussion, so that her spirits soon revived again.
In fact, with the weight of the secret off her mind,
she appeared even more vivacious than usual, which
left Barnes, although still obliged to listen attentively
with his eyes, free to follow his own thoughts.
And Miss Van Patten, though she apparently hung
upon every word that was spoken, was no less
free to pursue the trend of her own thoughts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
And both were conscious that each was doing
this.</p>

<p>There are blessed limits as to how far this matter
of chaperonage may be carried. Given two
people well in tune with one another and it is
doubtful if it amounts to very much. There are
instances of two who, at opposite ends of a crowded
church, have successfully found one another, and
in consequence heard but little of the sermon.
There are those who, in the midst of a vast crowd
with the band playing and people huzzaing, have
felt themselves as secluded as in a country lane.</p>

<p>It is certain that Barnes found himself conversing
quite freely with her who, leaning forward,
was giving such attention to her aunt. No words
were spoken, to be sure, for there was no need of
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You appear more beautiful to-night than I&#8217;ve
ever seen you,&#8221; he began boldly, if silently.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has that to do with the matter?&#8221; she
answered without moving her lips.</p>

<p>Barnes for the moment felt venturesome.</p>

<p>&#8220;As an artist,&#8221; was his reply, &#8220;it&#8217;s my duty
to take such details into account. Your eyes match
marvelously well with the candle light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your calling doesn&#8217;t give you the privilege of
being bold.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>&#8220;So long as the boldness is born of truth.
Your hair, too, is as a thousand candles burning
in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are thinking of my mother&#8217;s hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I see your hair as your father saw
your mother&#8217;s hair when the two were young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father was pleased by the tender way you
spoke to him of mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart was dangerously tender as through
you I saw your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think of danger&mdash;ever?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear at times, but I cannot tell whether it
is for myself or for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there to fear for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would answer that yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot. You must answer all questions you
ask of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, and they must be answered before they
are asked. But I will ask one;&mdash;what makes
your cheeks so red just now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the blood mounts high in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whence comes the blood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the heart, to be sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The heart must be over eager. Why is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a question for Dr. Merriweather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He might know more about it than most
doctors. But when all is said and done what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
a pitiful little your surgeon knows about the
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pitiful little anyone knows,&#8221; she
answered.</p>

<p>The hum of the doctor&#8217;s talk went on. Barnes,
as he watched the girl, caught her gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what sort of a picture you are painting
of me?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I see you dipping the
brush of your long lashes into the pigment of your
eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be sure that whatever it is, it is not
for exhibition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be half afraid to view it, if it
were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless you would criticise it. But it is
not half done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes one best catches the truth in a half-finished
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not as a maid paints.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How does a maid paint?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Backwards. She paints her picture and then
rubs out and out until sometimes she has nothing
left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if the likeness is good at the start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it stands. But there are many mutilated
pictures in a maid&#8217;s gallery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how does mine progress?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;So far as you may pierce the gallery windows
you may see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your eyes are such loop-holes. One has
to be within to see well from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must win your own position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A soldier&#8217;s privilege is mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The soldier&#8217;s privilege is every man&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, by my soul, I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela was rising from the table. How
was that? He had no memory of the intermediate
courses.</p>

<p>&#8220;You agree, boy?&#8221; demanded Dr. Merriweather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly,&#8221; faltered Barnes, &#8220;I agree
heartily.&#8221;</p>

<small>OUTSIDE THE DUTCH DOOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Before leaving, Dr. Merriweather found an opportunity
to draw Barnes one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize until to-night
to how great an extent Mr. Van Patten&#8217;s condition
is due to his mental state. He is already wonderfully
improved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you think there is now hope for
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to put it too strongly&mdash;but
there&#8217;s a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve told the others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We&#8217;ll wait a while before we do that.
But I wanted you to know and to thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were in the dark. The doctor struck a
match for his cigar. As the match flickered down,
he smiled a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll reap your reward for this somewhere,&#8221;
he concluded.</p>

<p>After the doctor had gone and the three were
alone again, Aunt Philomela confronted Barnes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me you were going to
confess the truth to Dr. Merriweather?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I didn&#8217;t know it myself until I saw
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You placed me in a very embarrassing position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought to rescue you from one,&#8221; exclaimed
Barnes with concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;After I had repeated to him that mess of stuff
you told me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my wish was to save you from further
committing yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had no business getting me into the
pickle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was quite by accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is always a young man&#8217;s plea. I saw
these complications coming from the first. Deceit
never succeeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, this has succeeded perfectly,&#8221;
Barnes protested. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure the doctor
thinks none the worse of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll never believe another word I say,&#8221; complained
Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;And will trust you in delicate matters as never
before,&#8221; affirmed Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;To tell him was the only honorable thing to
do,&#8221; broke in Miss Van Patten.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you tell Carl?&#8221; Aunt Philomela
challenged.</p>

<p>And with this shot Aunt Philomela promptly
withdrew before the enemy could fire back, forgetting,
however, that she was deserting her most
important outpost in so doing. Barnes could
scarcely believe his good fortune as he saw her
skirts switch upstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he sighed in relief, &#8220;that is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt really quite approves,&#8221; breathed the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she does,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she is probably waiting for me,&#8221; she
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;That gives me the strategical position,&#8221; he declared
cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should be in the army,&#8221; she commented
with heightened color.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use when you have given me the
soldier&#8217;s privilege?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; she exclaimed in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;At dinner,&#8221; he reminded her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember,&#8221; she murmured, trying hard
to recollect the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I spoke of the picture you are painting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have been talking to yourself,&#8221; she
declared with sudden light.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you were, too!&#8221; he challenged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>She appeared startled. He realized that this was
a good guess.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said I looked more like a soldier than
an artist,&#8221; he asserted, making a still wilder
guess.</p>

<p>She drew back a little now in genuine consternation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you shouldn&#8217;t read one&#8217;s thoughts,&#8221; she
protested.</p>

<p>She looked very tall and dark and beautiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is as far as I can go,&#8221; he admitted
reluctantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is as far as you have any right to go,&#8221; she
said hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see I talked to you all the while the doctor
talked to Aunt Philomela.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>The Princess stalked in and, glad of the relief,
she picked up the handsome cat. She herself
looked like a princess out of a story-book.</p>

<p>&#8220;You answered all my questions very evasively,&#8221;
he complained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they were not proper questions,&#8221; she
suggested as she stroked the silken back of the
other princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were somewhat direct,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some things it is very much wiser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
to keep to oneself,&#8221; she affirmed, looking up sharply
at him.</p>

<p>Again he saw a resemblance between her eyes
and the night sky over the orchard.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some things in which that matter
of so-called wisdom does not enter at all,&#8221; he
returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case caution should prompt us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caution is but a lame dog yelping at the
heels of Wisdom. Shall I tell you what we
discussed?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated. There was that about him to-night
which bewildered her. He was less a
stranger. Perhaps it was the drowsy night; perhaps
it was the fact that they stood here for the
first time alone, with the dark closing about them.
There seemed less to fear in him, more to fear in
herself. She answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you had better not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he submitted reluctantly, &#8220;perhaps my
conversation <i>was</i> in the nature of a confidential
communication to myself. Yet it is almost impossible
for me to believe you did not actually
share it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was still more difficult for her to resist the
invitation to share it now. The candle sputtering
on its last quarter ate its course voraciously as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
though in haste to blend this room with the rest
of the dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems so much we cannot share with
others,&#8221; she ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never felt it as I do this moment,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I think it must be a wonderful experience
to lead another through our own peculiar
treasure-house of memories. Out of the past we
gather so many things&mdash;alone; beautiful things, so
precious and fine that we hide them deep within
ourselves lest the light of merely curious eyes
should fade them. Perhaps some of us have partly
shared them with the world, in pictures or in
verse or in songs, but at best these are but
feeble copies. We haven&#8217;t done much but suggest
their form and color or the tune to which
they are set. But some day along comes one&mdash;to
share them. Then we go back to the Thames, the
Seine, and over the saffron road to the Schuyler
brook and take that other with us through all the
long galleries. So we know for the first time why
we have stored them all so carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes paused. His eyes had grown distant. Her
eyes had come nearer. The cat purred contentedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were to make a definition of happiness,&#8221;
he concluded, &#8220;it would be this; the privilege of
sharing utterly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>She knew. She had her own treasures&mdash;her
own gallery. But it had never occurred to her
that any other should ever see them. These pictures
were to be kept tight locked forever. They
were to be reviewed even by her only when alone in
the dark with the rest of the world tight asleep
around her. And now he had made her feel that
after all her greatest joy might come in showing
them to another. She looked up to find his eyes
upon her. They were so brilliant and yet so gentle
that they made her fear lest even now they might
pierce too deep.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may share most things,&#8221; she hastened to
speak, &#8220;but always there will be something left for
ourselves alone, won&#8217;t there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most always,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>They had remained standing. She leaned back
now against the door frame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221; he pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Oh, no!&#8221; she objected quickly.</p>

<p>But he brought a chair and with a smile placed
it near the door, as though to assure her of an easy
line of retreat. She passed it, and crossing the
room sat near the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;When making definitions,&#8221; he continued, seating
himself near the other window, &#8220;we have for
once an opportunity to speak without equivocation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
In reality, things go no further than &#8216;most always.&#8217;
We seldom attain the absolute. But,&#8221; he added,
lowering his voice a little, &#8220;I believe that it&#8217;s
possible in that one thing which I defined as
&#8216;sharing utterly.&#8217; I believe that once we may live
up to our definition. I believe it is within us all
to share once&mdash;utterly and without quibbling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t <i>seem</i> possible,&#8221; she answered weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think it would be quite confusing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think it would be quite dizzily
clarifying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the same mental condition?&#8221; she
laughed timidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The difference is the difference in the effect
produced by champagne and the effect produced by
mountain air,&#8221; he stated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose some such freedom is what we all
strive for,&#8221; she said quickly, with broad generalization.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is but little striving in it,&#8221; he affirmed.
&#8220;It is the one time when the mountain comes to
Mahomet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But even then Mahomet must climb the mountain,&#8221;
she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;He soars to the top, winged,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>The candle began to give warning. The unsnuffed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
wick leaned over drunkenly and unfairly
ate down its sides. But a candle may not be criticised,
however unjust its acts. Barnes saw that
it was too late to correct its knavish course though
the evening was still young; in two minutes it
would unceremoniously snuff out the girl&#8217;s eyes.
It gave fair warning.</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten arose. He had nothing to do
but to arise also.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall emulate Mahomet,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I
shall soar to the top of the stairs, winged.&#8221;</p>

<p>She answered only,</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the simple words set his pulse to beating
faster. There was in them something of the &#8217;cello
note.</p>

<p>He bowed as she passed before him. She hurried
on to Aunt Philomela, and he crossed to the
candle and blew it out. He found that after all
the dark did not make so much difference.</p>

<p>Barnes made his way to the little Dutch door,
opened it and stepped out into the night. As he
did so a man who was retreating down the path
turned and came back. It was Langdon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he called. &#8220;I had hoped to catch you,
but when I saw the light go out, I thought you
must have retired.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>&#8220;You wished to see me?&#8221; Barnes asked in
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, Joe,&#8221; answered Langdon nervously.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind if I call you Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; answered Barnes, indifferently.</p>

<p>But the name instantly destroyed some beautiful
dreams he had come out there to dream.</p>

<p>He sat down on the stone step but Langdon
remained standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; Langdon began, &#8220;that as long as
Mr. Van Patten is so ill and you&#8217;re the man of
the family now, I ought to come to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Barnes in surprise.</p>

<p>Langdon faltered on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I&#8217;ve been down here this summer my
music has meant more to me than it ever did before.
I&#8217;ve been able to express things through it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sister sort of makes a man understand,&#8221;
he ventured.</p>

<p>Barnes drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you driving at?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to tell you,&#8221; answered Langdon,
earnestly, &#8220;but I want you to understand me
first. I know how business men feel about music.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Business men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They think music and such things are for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
women, don&#8217;t they? They think Art doesn&#8217;t test
you like gold hunting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose some do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it doesn&#8217;t&mdash;like gold hunting. It
doesn&#8217;t make you muscular. But for two years
now I&#8217;ve stood in front of a mirror and drawn
a bow across a fiddle for eight hours, then stopped
an hour, and done it again. It isn&#8217;t easy to do
that&mdash;all alone. It takes a sort of brawn, doesn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think it might,&#8221; agreed Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been nothing but work up to now,&#8221; Langdon
ran on. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just been learning to play.
I couldn&#8217;t see what it was leading to&mdash;until this
summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221; inquired Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ve found out. Eleanor has made me
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes ran his hand over his brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe, she&#8217;s made me hope for big things; she&#8217;s
filled my soul full of big songs. Don&#8217;t you understand
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;you love her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon came nearer and held out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>Barnes took his hand. The purple of the night
sky turned to leaden gray.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>&#8220;Have you told her?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&mdash;I thought I ought to tell you first.
You know what a wonderful creature she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So&mdash;so I thought you ought to know something
about the man who wants to ask for her
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very decent of you. But&mdash;I haven&#8217;t
anything to say about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She thinks a great deal of you,&#8221; said Langdon.</p>

<p>Barnes did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d marry anyone you didn&#8217;t
approve of,&#8221; Langdon laughed nervously. &#8220;I
never heard a sister admire her brother as she does
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; gasped Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you oughtn&#8217;t to repeat those things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d almost be glad to be just her brother if
she talked that way about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Then Langdon resumed,</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I your permission to ask her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>My</i> permission?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d rather, I&#8217;ll wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes took a long breath. Then he grasped
Langdon&#8217;s hand again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said earnestly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d
wait very long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. And I may tell her I have your
consent?&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon gripped his hand once more. Barnes
turned abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll excuse me? I&#8217;m going in now. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes closed the little Dutch door behind him.
And instead of soaring, winged, to the top of the
stairs, he plodded up as though he were carrying
a great weight upon his shoulders.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>PLAYING THE GAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Barnes had said to Aunt Philomela when she
demurred at certain things running counter to her
own convictions, &#8220;Now that we have begun this
game, we must play it for all it&#8217;s worth. We must
stick it out to the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lying there in his room on the little white bed,
Barnes repeated that again to himself. It meant
just one thing; that in all fairness, he must now
play the brother in this household as well as the
prodigal. He had been admitted within these sacred
precincts not as a friend, but as an actor. Honor
demanded that he must not presume further than
this. That was as clear as a June morning. To
take advantage of his position for any personal consideration
would be to turn traitor to the old gentleman,
to Aunt Philomela, to the girl herself.</p>

<p>Well and good. There was no sense in arguing
further along this line. As a gentleman it did not
behoove him to discuss it even with himself. Looking
then at Langdon&#8217;s suit impersonally, as a brother,
how must he consider it? Dr. Merriweather was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
sufficient voucher for the man&#8217;s social standing.
What of the man himself? He had seen enough of
him to realize that he was clean-limbed, clean-hearted.
He had also had a glimpse into the man&#8217;s
soul and had found there a brother artist.</p>

<p>Barnes sprang from the bed and taking a chair
by the open window inhaled the perfumed night
breeze. He was tempted hard to throw this whole
matter from his mind, but he gripped himself.
Langdon had said, &#8220;She has filled my soul with
song.&#8221;</p>

<p>And his own soul this same woman had filled with
pictures. He saw down the whole long gallery.
There were the pictures by the Thames, by the
Seine, by the saffron road, and by the Schuyler
brook. They waited but the touch of her fingers
upon his arm to spring into reality for all the world
to admire. Barnes was breathing rapidly. He
checked himself.</p>

<p>There, too, in another heart were the songs. They
waited but the brush&mdash;of her lips&mdash;to be sung. It
came hard to acknowledge that. His ancestors,
facing English guns, never did a harder thing.</p>

<p>Looking at the matter frankly then, as an artist
as well as a brother, there was no ground upon
which he could contest Langdon&#8217;s right to sue for
this girl&#8217;s hand. There remained only his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
man right to fight for his life. But he could not
avail himself of this except by deserting this old
gentleman&mdash;except by coming upon the field frankly
as an enemy. His thoughts continually went back
to the army code; he was here, as it were, upon
parole. To abuse that position would be as cowardly
a thing as to fire upon a flag of truce.</p>

<p>It took Barnes four feverish hours to thresh out
these manifest truths, but when it was over he found
himself in a state of curious self-possession. He
had never felt calmer in his life. But somehow this
room was not big enough for him; he felt the
need of getting out where there was nothing overhead
between him and the stars, where to the right
and left he should be bounded only by the East
and the West. He had not undressed, so he stole
out of the room, down the stairs and out by the little
Dutch door. It was odd how important a part, first
and last, this inanimate object had played in his
life. It was this which had first attracted him to
the house; it was through this that he had led her
when they had gone to the hill-top together; hard
by this that Langdon had made his confession;
and now it furnished him a temporary means of
escape from his prison.</p>

<p>Barnes made his way to the top of the hill. The
air was cool, the sky was deep, and below him, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
the ghost of itself, lay the saffron road. He studied
it with grim interest. It was no longer a glad highway
through the King&#8217;s dominions and it no longer
led on, but away. Even the big atlas in the library
had proven that in whatever direction he might
journey, it must always be away.</p>

<p>There was only one path now which offered him
even a destination and that was back to his mother.
If it had been possible he would have pushed on in
the dark along this ghost road until he reached her.
He would like to sit in the park with her and talk
over things. He strode a half dozen steps down the
hill. Then he came back. When the old gentleman
now sleeping so peacefully awoke, he would ask for
his son. The thin hands would fumble about for
another hand and they must find what they sought.</p>

<p>Barnes threw himself down flat and elbows on
the ground rested his chin in his hands. Below
him in shadow lay all that vast unexplored country
upon which only yesterday he had gazed with her by
his side. To-night it was boundless&mdash;limitless.
Where before it had seemed like a virgin woodland,
sun-lighted, it now seemed as somber as a Dor&eacute;
forest. It would be a grim affair&mdash;adventuring
through this land alone. The pictures a man would
bring back with him&mdash;Ah, they would be pictures
of Hell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>The dawn came softly, tenderly, and like evil before
a good woman, the shadows stole away. The
dawn came just as Eleanor might come into a room
at dusk and light the candles. In the ivory East
appeared the red that was in her cheeks; in the
black, lowhanging clouds, appeared the gold that was
in the black of her hair. A fierce desire for his
paints seized him. No one had ever pictured the
dawn because no one before had ever divined its
secret. The dawn was Eleanor.</p>

<p>He heard footsteps behind and glancing around
saw Langdon. The latter paused, started, and then
came on again. His face was alight and he looked
like one inspired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe,&#8221; he said half in awe, &#8220;to put that into
music, you would have to put Eleanor into music.
Then&mdash;then&mdash;what a symphony you would have!&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God, man,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;what brought you
to this spot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you hear it?&#8221; persisted Langdon. &#8220;The
world all dark and cavernous&mdash;like those days in
Paris; then her voice calling&mdash;far in the distance;
then a low morning song, like a morning
prayer; then her voice coming nearer until, in a
wild medley of song, her presence breaks upon the
world and the world awakes&mdash;as a soul awakes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>Standing very erect, his head back, Langdon faced
the East.</p>

<p>And Barnes facing Langdon saw his picture fade&mdash;fade&mdash;until
some demon in him made him feel
for a moment that it would be right for him to
battle with this man in defense of his own. How
simple it would be if here on this hill-top in the
early morning the two might grapple until one was
left supreme. Langdon turned and caught a flash
in the eyes of this other which drove the music
from his soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You look
feverish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes did not answer for a moment. He very
deliberately sat down. He felt ashamed of this
primeval instinct. If in the days to follow he
couldn&#8217;t show any better control over himself than
this, he had better find it out now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Langdon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What got you
up so early?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dawn,&#8221; answered Langdon.</p>

<p>As he seated himself, he took one swift look at
Barnes&#8217; face, but he soon forgot whatever it was he
had observed a second ago. He had more vital
things in mind than the passing mood of a
prodigal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sleep,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Somehow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
the fact of having spoken to you made all the
things I&#8217;ve been merely dreaming all this while
seem intensely real.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t let them be too real until&mdash;I had
spoken to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Langdon answered quickly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
wish to presume. But a man isn&#8217;t responsible for
his unbidden thoughts, is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is?&#8221; asked Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one. No one&mdash;on earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But every man has to stand for himself&mdash;the
consequences of his thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to do that. But&mdash;well, I don&#8217;t
suppose you realize how big a part a woman plays
in work of my sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the very life of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very life,&#8221; repeated Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;In business, it&#8217;s every man for himself; but
in music you&#8217;ve got to have someone to sing to,
someone to play for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the masters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, when a man&#8217;s a genius, it&#8217;s different. But
when you&#8217;re just human&mdash;well, that&#8217;s all I am
and I&#8217;m glad of it. I don&#8217;t care for lonely grandeur,
Joe. I only want to climb as high as I can go
with Eleanor.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;Good Lord,&#8221; exploded Barnes, &#8220;can a man go
any higher than that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t at any rate,&#8221; answered Langdon, simply.</p>

<p>Barnes studied him a moment. Then he said
more quietly, &#8220;And you&#8217;re sure you can go as far
as that? You&#8217;re sure you can go as high as she
can take you, Langdon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man can&#8217;t tell, Joe,&#8221; answered Langdon,
sincerely, &#8220;but at times&mdash;like this morning&mdash;I
feel as though there were no heights I couldn&#8217;t
reach. She seems to put the whole world into song.
I find myself trying to set to music everything she
looks at. It&#8217;s wonderful. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s almost terrifying.
Why, when you were telling her about
Alaska&mdash;I watched her eyes and almost caught a
symphony there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes moved uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded Langdon. &#8220;It seems as
though you ought to understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your eyes,&#8221; answered Langdon.</p>

<p>He leaned closer and for a second stared into
them. Then he rose and stood in front of Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why there&#8217;s a symphony in them,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;A great, big tragic theme&mdash;of some
sort!&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes smiled grimly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>&#8220;If I were an artist,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;d paint you
as you stand there saying that, Langdon. There&#8217;s
a big triumphant picture in you&mdash;of some sort!&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes made his feet and for a moment the men
stood side by side looking down upon the green valley
which was slowly coming to life there below them.
What a song it was; what a picture it was! The
blazing sun was big enough to make both of it. For
a second Barnes caught a flash of some hidden meaning
in this thought. Then his face hardened; even
the sun could not do both through one man alone.</p>

<p>Barnes turned abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you after breakfast, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Langdon, &#8220;I&#8217;ll come over
early.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes hesitated. This hill-top now seemed like
a strategic point. To go meant leaving Langdon in
possession. But this was only a concrete example
of the whole problem which he had worked out earlier
in the night. If he had entered this household
upon the same plane upon which Langdon had entered
it, then he would have a right to remain on
the hill-top and fight for his pictures and all those
meant. But he hadn&#8217;t. That was the point. When
he left Aunt Philomela that first night and went upstairs,
he had given a silent pledge of honor. To
some men this might seem a nice point, open at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
least to argument. But Barnes all his life had lived
by nice points. That was his glory as an artist.
Without another word, he trudged back down the
hill.</p>

<p>The house was still asleep. It looked like a very
young girl asleep. It took the morning light drowsily
and peacefully. Beneath the windows, the
flowers fresh from their dew bath met the eye of the
sky proudly and unashamed. It was impossible for
Barnes, in the face of these things, to brood. He
couldn&#8217;t as yet endure the confines of his room, but
he strode off down the damp road with good spirit.
Then he turned off to the right and crossed the fields
to the brook. Here in a clump of alders he undressed
and threw himself into the stinging cold waters.
As he bobbed up pink with every vein responding,
he shook the water from his eyes and struck across
to the other bank. So for ten minutes he swam in
and out over the clean sands and water-cress like
the king trout himself. And when he came out it
was with his brain clear and his heart beating
sturdily.</p>

<p>Barnes found Mr. Van Patten awake and waiting
for him when he came back to the house. The old
gentleman measured time by the twittering of the
birds in the morning, and their sleepy chirp at
night. His voice was stronger and the grip of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
hand on Barnes&#8217; arm firmer. But more than this
Barnes noticed that which at first frightened him&mdash;an
awakening in the aged face, a new expression
about the eyes in place of the blank, fixed stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the curtains raised?&#8221; demanded Mr. Van
Patten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Barnes, &#8220;as high as usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put them way up,&#8221; insisted Mr. Van Patten.
&#8220;I want all the light there is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes snapped them to the top. The room became
flooded with the morning sunshine. When he
turned, the old gentleman was upon his elbow straining
towards them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Barnes asked in some alarm.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Patten fell back again with almost a
smile about his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Sit over here by my
side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes took his usual position between the windows
and the bed. Mr. Van Patten turned to face
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I lost five years of you out
of my life and I&#8217;ve been wondering just how far
I&#8217;m to blame for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s all over with now,&#8221; suggested
Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as I&#8217;m concerned. But there&#8217;s you&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
don&#8217;t want you to suffer what I suffered. I want
you to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a son, I&#8217;ve learned,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;But not as a father, Joe. I suppose some day
you&#8217;ll marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And have a son of your own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t sound probable just at present,&#8221;
answered Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you will, my boy. And the best I can
pray for you is that you&#8217;ll find another woman like
your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was just one woman like that mother to
whom the old gentleman referred. Barnes caught
his breath at thought of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose there is another,&#8221; murmured Mr. Van
Patten. &#8220;For someone, Eleanor is going to be just
such another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Barnes. &#8220;I think she&#8217;s that one
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Van Patten moved uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easier to think of your marrying than of
Eleanor marrying,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I suppose she
will. Have you seen much of Carl?&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes jumped at the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I&#8217;ve&mdash;I&#8217;ve seen
a good deal of him lately.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that, Joe. Eleanor has been thrown
in with him nearly every day this summer. What
sort of a man does he appear&mdash;to a man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve talked with him yourself, haven&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much. I haven&#8217;t felt like seeing anyone.
Aunt Philomela likes him. Do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a direct question. Barnes answered it
directly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is clean and sincere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor says he has a very great gift in music.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no judge of that, but I believe he&#8217;s honest
as an artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well. Well. The girl must choose for herself.
I&#8217;ve thought the intimacy was growing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would make her happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she loves him, I have no doubt of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she must be sure of her love. I trust you,
Joe, to make that point clear to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you may trust <i>her</i> for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will act up to her conviction but she is
young&mdash;younger than her years. And I&mdash;without
my eyes&mdash;I can&#8217;t be much of a father.&#8221; He
reached for Barnes&#8217; hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>&#8220;You must be son and father and brother all in
one, Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you will, boy. I know you will.
You&#8217;ve grown wonderfully in these last five years.
But I think you would have grown just the same
if you had not gone away. The fault was mine. I
didn&#8217;t stay young enough for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem very young to me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes. I&#8217;ve grown young. That is the secret
I&#8217;ve worked out in the dark; as the son grows old,
the father must grow young.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess stalked into the room and jumped
upon the bed. The father reached out to stroke her
back and faced the door for Eleanor. She entered
with the blush of the morning in her cheeks. She
nodded with a smile at Barnes and then with a little
laugh pressed her lips against her father&#8217;s forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;you look so much better.
You look so much better every morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll soon be out of bed now,&#8221; he answered with
conviction.</p>

<p>Then he did the same thing which had startled
Barnes upon his entrance&mdash;he rose to his elbow
and strained his eyes towards the girl as though he
had suddenly become endowed with his sight again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
Miss Van Patten glanced up swiftly at Barnes, as
though for an explanation. The latter could only
stare back.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble, Daddy?&#8221; she stammered.</p>

<p>His face was not troubled but he did not look
as he looked yesterday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, child, nothing. Dr. Merriweather is
coming to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I send for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but if Carl comes over&mdash;Carl is coming
to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me that he was coming this morning,&#8221;
put in Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then when he comes, tell him to ask the doctor
to drop over this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Van Patten smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe says he finds Carl a fine fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl glanced up swiftly at Barnes. He met
her eyes fairly. Then he nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I think he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Daddy,&#8221; she exclaimed, and her cheeks
grew a deeper crimson as she spoke, &#8220;you have
seen him. You know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The young are better judges of the young, than
the old are,&#8221; he answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>And reaching for her hand, he patted it tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carl has often said he wished to see more of
you, Daddy. Perhaps now that you&#8217;re stronger&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe must see for me,&#8221; answered Mr. Van Patten.
&#8220;I leave Carl to him for the present.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will come up again&mdash;after
Carl arrives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon he retired. To all intents and purposes
it was a retreat.</p>

<small>JOHN GIVES HIS NOTICE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Aunt Philomela was waiting breakfast in no very
good humor. On the previous evening, she had sat
up for an hour listening to the unintelligible hum of
her niece&#8217;s voice without being able to catch a word
of what she said. And when Miss Van Patten had
finally stolen into the room, Aunt Philomela had
found little relief in her questioning. The remainder
of the night she had made a martyr of herself.
She dreamed that Eleanor had run away with
a ne&#8217;er do well artist, deserting her poor old aunt
and her sick father. Then, in her dream, Mr. Van
Patten had died, thereby leaving her a lonely,
heart-broken old woman finding what solace she
might in consecrating her life to the poor of the
village. And that, after all, was a poor sort of consolation.</p>

<p>So when Aunt Philomela came down she was in
no mood to be trifled with. Yet it was just this inopportune
moment that John chose to explode a
bomb-shell at her feet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>&#8220;I beg your pardon, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he stammered, &#8220;but
I wishes to give my notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;what?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wishes to give my notice,&#8221; he repeated with
more self-assertiveness than she had ever suspected
was in the man.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela plumped herself down in a chair
and folded her hands in her lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;I never heard of such a
thing in all my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>John automatically adjusted his tie and ran his
hand over his chin. He had been particularly careful
in his toilet this morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what pray may be your reason?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothin&#8217; as you might say,&#8221; he answered uneasily,
&#8220;that you can put your hands on, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you get enough to eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you well enough paid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t take no more, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you secured another position?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he hastened to assure her as though
freeing himself from the charge of treason.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a nice, clean place to sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man could ask for nothing better, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>If anything it was too clean and nice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>&#8220;Then what in the world is the matter with
you?&#8221; she exclaimed, the mystery deepening.</p>

<p>John cleared his throat. This was a difficult
matter to express. There have been plenty of better
men in a like position&mdash;men with well-defined
notions of what they wished to say but when the
time came with no words to say them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;if I says I hasn&#8217;t
slept for three nights that will be enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then all you need is a tonic,&#8221; she affirmed,
brightening. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get the bottle&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She had half risen when he checked her. He
remembered with decided unpleasantness the taste
of that dark liquid which she kept for the occasional
indispositions of her staff.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m. It isn&#8217;t anything that medicine can
fairly reach, ma&#8217;am. Thank you, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if it isn&#8217;t your blood, it&#8217;s your nerves,&#8221;
she declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nerves comes nearer it,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you need a vacation,&#8221; she hazarded,
though the prospect of being left without John was
unthinkable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had thought of going off somewhere,&#8221; he
confessed.</p>

<p>There was something in the way he said it&mdash;something
in the way he glanced swiftly upward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
towards Mr. Barnes&#8217; room that gave her a clew.
She sat bolt upright.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to tell me you&#8217;ve got your fool
head turned about Alaska, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>John nodded weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>was</i> the Artcic that set me goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you&mdash;you&#8217;d freeze to death there,&#8221; she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, ma&#8217;am, I wasn&#8217;t thinking of going there,&#8221;
he hastened to assure her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what&mdash;&#8221; she stammered, all at sea again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wants to get away from the Artcic,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;I wants to get as far away as I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t get any farther away than this
without running into the ocean.&#8221;</p>

<p>John tiptoed nearer. He spoke in a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;He brought it with him,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>He turned his eyes towards the stairs again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he bring?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It,&#8221; answered John. &#8220;The Thing under the
bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did? Why, he was never within a thousand
miles of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She checked herself just in time. John&#8217;s eyes
had begun to open wide. She was in a position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
more embarrassing than any which had yet grown
out of this course of deceit. If there were any one
thing more vital than cleanliness which she had impressed
upon her servants, it was truthfulness. She
had held it before their eyes as a clear translucent
crystal. And now was she to be forced to violate
it herself? Was she to be thrust into the position of
being untruthful to her own butler? Her weak
limbs shook beneath her at her helplessness. Her
cheeks turned scarlet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; commented John.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t know! She would have given a year
of her life if she didn&#8217;t know. If only she herself
were so deluded that she might innocently repeat
those outrageous yarns, she could at least preserve
her self respect. But no, she must sit dumb, expressing
a silent lie.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Things,&#8221; whispered John, &#8220;that you
doesn&#8217;t even suspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this she roused herself. She scented a new
danger. Perhaps John was eavesdropping last
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she demanded, with some
show of her old spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the closet. Under the bed,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>The surprise occasioned by this unexpected statement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
bewildered her still more. Surprise had followed
surprise, until now she could make neither
head nor tail out of John&#8217;s fears.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says as how it has to do with gold,&#8221; continued
John.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it was he who told you about this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am. That&#8217;s the trouble. I don&#8217;t mind
anything I can lay my hands on.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew himself to his full height.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; choked Aunt Philomela, in helpless
wrath, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you face it like a man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it didn&#8217;t come from the Artcic, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it didn&#8217;t,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you knows about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered coldly, &#8220;I know all about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ve seen it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need to see it, to know all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>John looked skeptical.</p>

<p>&#8220;People always thinks things isn&#8217;t so until he
sees them himself,&#8221; he observed sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a frightfully ungrammatical sentence,&#8221;
she commented.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t take grammar to see them,&#8221; he ventured
with some truth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; she snorted.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden she came to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you what you&#8217;re going to do,&#8221; she
stormed, stepping towards him. &#8220;You&#8217;re going
back to your work and think no more about these
fool things. You leave them to me. I&#8217;ll attend
to them. You understand? Go back to your work
and do no more talking about leaving or I&#8217;ll discharge
you quicker than you can say Jack Robinson.
You needn&#8217;t worry about any more Things
or Its. I&#8217;ll attend to those, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>John had been slowly pressed back. His spirit
had quite gone at the first sentence. He was not
a timid man, but it took more than human courage
to stand before Aunt Philomela in such a
mood. He would thank his stars if he could only
get safely into the buttery again. She paused a
moment, and John threw himself against the
swinging door and disappeared. Aunt Philomela
turned around.</p>

<p>It was this auspicious moment that Barnes chose
for entering. Aunt Philomela swung upon him
before he had time even to say good-morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s honorable to scare a poor
old butler half to death?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>He glanced around as though he expected to see
the corpse of the poor butler lying upon the floor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s the poor old
butler who has been trying to frighten me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be thankful if he had succeeded,&#8221; she
snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a mystic&mdash;that man,&#8221; declared Barnes.
&#8220;He is a seer of things in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who put the foolish notions into his
head?&#8221; she insisted unflinchingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who? I should like to know as well as you.
Who taught him to walk on tiptoe? Who taught
him to appear as though through a trap-door?
Who taught him to look suddenly about as though
in league with the unknown? Who&mdash;&#8221; he demanded
darkly, &#8220;taught him to look under beds?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela caught her breath at this last
query.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; she returned weakly, &#8220;I never made
him believe he saw anything under there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; he hastened to explain. &#8220;That is
what bothered us both; we couldn&#8217;t find anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she observed sarcastically. &#8220;Perhaps
you wish to enter a complaint against John.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment John himself entered with the
coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; announced Barnes, &#8220;I beg to report<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
that the Thing is gone. Pouf!&#8221; he snapped his
fingers. &#8220;All gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You really thinks so?&#8221; stammered John.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a dollar for every time you find
him after this,&#8221; agreed Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, sir, I wouldn&#8217;t find him for a hundred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll let him go. As a matter of fact
it got too hot for him around here. He&#8217;s used to
a colder climate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good, sir. I hope you sleeps better at
night for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoping you will the same, I beg to remain,&#8221;
he concluded, quoting from the personal circular
letter of the Acme.</p>

<p>John went out with a brisker step than he had
shown for a number of days, and in at the other
door, with an even brisker step, came Eleanor.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine a fairer harbinger
of peace than she, and yet it required all her
best efforts to dissipate the cloud which hung over
the breakfast table that morning. Barnes, who was
always ready to assist at such an undertaking, was
strangely silent, while Aunt Philomela refused to
enthuse even over the marked change for the better
in her brother&#8217;s condition. Everyone was glad
when the meal was finished. When they rose, Carl
had not yet appeared. Barnes braced himself to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the task ahead. As Miss Van Patten stood uncertain
just what to do next, he suggested that she
come with him into the flower-garden for a breath
of the morning air. She appeared a bit startled but
acquiesced, and so they made their way out doors.</p>

<p>Just how far it was his right to go, just how
far it was his duty as a brother to go, Barnes did
not know, but that he must say something in view
of what was coming he had no doubt. She was
bending over her flowers plucking off dead leaves
when he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your father seemed to be
very much interested in Carl this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much interested,&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>She gave him no encouragement. He looked
about anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;He and I both agreed that Carl is a fine fellow,&#8221;
he observed. She raised her head at this.
She looked at him without embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carl is an artist,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You and Carl
ought to have much in common.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much in common?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;We have.
We have too much in common.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her question was as direct and unsuspicious as
a child&#8217;s.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>&#8220;We agree on so very many things that&mdash;well,
you know it&#8217;s sometimes more comfortable to
disagree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With Aunt Philomela, for instance. We get
on much better by disagreeing than we should if
we looked at things in just the same way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But at bottom, you know, you and Aunt Philomela
really agree. She wouldn&#8217;t quarrel with
you if she didn&#8217;t agree with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; he asked with interest. &#8220;What would
she do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would be very polite with you,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be terrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least, it would be uninteresting. She is
polite to the Reverend John Powers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t met him yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. But you can never tell when you
may meet him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bent over her flowers again. Barnes tried
to collect his thoughts. He hadn&#8217;t got very far
with that beginning.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing that impressed both your father and
me about Carl&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>She lifted her head once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she inquired sweetly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>If he could only paint her as she stood now&mdash;as
though she were growing in the garden! So
few women really get up until after lunch, but
she&mdash;she, like the poppies, awoke with the kiss
of the sun into her full beauty. There was no
trace of the night about her. All her dreams were
tucked away in the long gallery with her pictures.
Yesterday was one with ten thousand yesterdays
and she was as though new born for this day alone.
This was especially true of her eyes. As the planets
bear no trace of the eternal cycles through which
they have ranged, but come each night new created,
so her eyes were almost abstract in their freshness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she said, to break the silence,
&#8220;I suppose I ought to take Aladdin out to-day.
He&#8217;s been shut up in his stall for a week now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yesterday he would have protested. Now he
basely betrayed his trust.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are going to ride, you ought to ride this
morning, oughtn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I think I ought to go
at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt a bit uncomfortable, but if Carl didn&#8217;t
know enough to take quick advantage of his opportunity
that was his own fault. Surely his duty
as a brother did not go so far as to manage Carl&#8217;s
wooing. She started towards the stable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>&#8220;I will go just as I am,&#8221; she determined.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I will help you saddle the horse,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Aladdin heard her coming before her feet had
touched the barn floor and greeted her with a glad
whinny. He cropped at her fingers as she untied
the halter rope. Sam, the man of all work, came
up, but she would have none of his help. She led
out the strong-limbed animal and in a jiffy adjusted
his bridle. The most that Barnes found
to do was to throw the saddle over his back, and
even then she insisted upon fastening the girths
herself. Barnes kept his eye down the road and
became as impatient as Aladdin himself for the
start.</p>

<p>Sam held out his hand and her foot scarcely
touched it as she vaulted lightly into the saddle.
And then how like a queen she looked! Her long
skirt made her seem even more like one of those
for whom King Arthur&#8217;s knights fought.</p>

<p>She spoke a word to Aladdin, waved her hand,
and in all too brief a space was out of sight.</p>

<p>Barnes went back to the house. Near the Dutch
door he met Carl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; explained Barnes, &#8220;has just galloped
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took an immense amount of satisfaction in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
conveying this slight bit of news. But the next
second his enthusiasm vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; answered Langdon. &#8220;Why, then,
I guess I&#8217;ll go down the road and meet her as she
comes back.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE ROAD COMPLICATES MATTERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>With the breeze singing past her ears, Eleanor
continued down the very road along which she had
walked with Mr. Barnes when she had gone with
him to the station for his bag. She smiled. She
was quite sure that had she been with Carl she
would not have forgotten her mission. But of
course that was quite easy of explanation; Carl
was, comparatively speaking, an old friend now.
With old friends one didn&#8217;t forget one&#8217;s errands.</p>

<p>As she galloped along she seemed to hear Barnes
talking to her again. She recalled all that he had
told her of his life, of his college days, of his journey
abroad, of his family at home, and the motive
which had prompted him to undertake his
vagabond trip through these hills. She had taken
it as a pretty compliment that he told her these
things&mdash;especially after his confession that he had
not intended to do so. She smiled again. She
could smile safely here alone on Aladdin&#8217;s back.
And there is nothing so worth smiling at as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
woman power which makes a man do something
against his will.</p>

<p>She passed the apple-trees, the pines, and was
well into the maple-grove before she slackened her
pace. Aladdin was in fine fettle and resented the
pull of the bit which slowed him down into a walk.
He tossed his head and jerked up his forelegs as
though doing a quadrille. But now her thoughts
had come back to this morning and to the curious
emphasis which both men were placing upon Carl.
Somehow Carl did not seem a man who should
be emphasized. He came as a pleasant part of
a summer day, and though at times when they
had been playing together he had been able to
sweep her on into a more rarefied atmosphere, he
always brought her back again when he put down
his bow. The thing she had liked about him was
that he had always been so unobtrusive and yet
by this very method he had made for himself a
place in her life. If Carl should go she would
miss him. She would be almost homesick for him.
He was ever gentle, ever thoughtful, ever ready in
his quiet way to fill an hour that without him
would be tedious. Then at intervals came, too,
those rare moments when he suggested to her a
new life&mdash;when he led her to the hill-top. In
a word, Carl had taken her as he found her, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
blended himself with her, until now he was as
important to her in a way as Aunt Philomela, the
old brick house, or Aladdin and the Princess.</p>

<p>She had never quarreled with Carl. She could
not imagine such a thing. It would be as senseless
as quarreling with herself. He understood her
perfectly and she understood him perfectly and
each had too much respect for the other ever to
force an issue. Before a clash came either he
would surrender a point or she would surrender
a point, and so they would go on together harmoniously.
She could always affect a compromise with
Carl. With a little glow of satisfaction she realized
that she could trust herself to him with this
sure knowledge. If love meant peace, then she
and Carl were lovers.</p>

<p>With a little gasp of surprise she realized this
was just what her father had hinted at; with a
burning of the cheeks and a tightening of her throat
she realized that this was what Barnes had tried
to tell her. With her father she accepted his concern
with nothing more than maidenly confusion
at having it for the first time put so starkly; but
with Barnes she felt a touch of resentment.</p>

<p>From the first moment she had met Barnes he
had a way, in spite of all his well meaning, of
making her uncomfortable. He had forced her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
into a position which, however she might defend
it to Aunt Philomela, which, however much it justified
itself, certainly had not been conducive to
peace in her own mind. Had she met Carl for
the first time by the letter-box that day, he would
never have suggested such a disturbing adventure
as this upon which Barnes had embarked her.
Carl would have realized her position perfectly,
would have sympathized with her fully, and would
have helped her to do that which out of her own
conscience she would have known must be done.
In the end he might have taken his violin and
brought her solace for the inevitable consequences.</p>

<p>Again, in all the days she had known Carl he
had never urged her to run counter to any wish
of Aunt Philomela&#8217;s. He would never have persuaded
her to walk to the station with him after
his bag, and certainly would never have forgotten
the bag after starting. He would never have made
her go fishing; he would never have put her into
an embarrassing position before the cook or in the
library; he would never have made her so uncomfortable
as she was this minute sitting upon
Aladdin.</p>

<p>She touched her horse&#8217;s neck and he broke again
into a gallop. Within sight of the station, she
turned and rode back again for fully two miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
without stopping. When she did stop it was at
sight of Carl swinging down a level stretch of road
a full mile distant. Then, upon the spur of the
moment, she turned once more and galloped back
towards the station. But once well hidden by a
turn in the road, she drew up the horse and continued
at a walk.</p>

<p>This unusual act was not so much inspired by
Carl as by Barnes. Her cheeks grew scarlet but
she faced the fact squarely. She wished to think
a bit more about this man who had strode so soldier-like
into her life&mdash;even though it made her
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Carl had spoken of some great tragedy which
he had seen in Barnes&#8217; eyes. She herself had not
seen it until this morning, when for a second as
he had stood with her by her father&#8217;s bedside she
seemed to feel it; and again later, when at breakfast,
he had flashed a look at her which suggested
a pain which with difficulty he held in control.
Yet, when she had repeated Carl&#8217;s words to him,
he had denied the tragedy, and he was a man to tell
the truth. Perhaps he himself did not yet recognize
it. Perhaps it was as yet something which
he refused to admit even to himself. The thought
roused in her a queer little motherly concern. He
was doing so much for her that it seemed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
though there must be something she could do in
return.</p>

<p>She laughed at herself. He was not a man to
need any such slight help as she might be able to
give him. A man who talked so sturdily of adventuring&mdash;a
man who faced the purple rim of
the sky with no other emotion than eagerness to be
over it&mdash;did not need her, who only drew back
from it in awe.</p>

<p>She had looked at a hundred sunsets with Carl.
He had helped her to see the beauties in them, had
made her feel the song in them, had brought home
to her a sense of peace in them. But he had
never left her wondering; he had never sent her
back through the little Dutch door half in fear.</p>

<p>She caught herself with a start. She had drifted
unconsciously into a comparison of these two men.
To say the least, this was presumptuous of her.
She turned Aladdin once more and gave him the
bit. He sprang as though at a hurdle and cut his
feet into the hard road. She sat upon his back
with her thoughts so far away that she was scarcely
conscious of riding. So she took the first turn in
the road more carelessly than usual. She had just
time to swerve one side from an automobile which
rounded the corner. She lost her balance, regained
it, and, still unsteady in her seat, knew that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
for the first time in his life Aladdin had lost his
head.</p>

<p>She was not frightened, but the unexpectedness
of the emergency took all the strength from her.
When she pulled at the bit she found her arms
as weak as a child&#8217;s. She tried to speak, but
found her tongue dumb. As she swayed in the
saddle she saw Carl. He was watching her approach
unable to make out whether it was a wild
ride or a runaway. Then she fell sideways, and
her foot caught in the stirrup. She had a vague
memory of Carl&#8217;s white face as he stood in the
middle of the road; remembered seeing him spring,
and then the dark closed in upon her.</p>

<p>When again she came to herself, she was lying by
the roadside and Carl was bending over her. Her
face was wet and he was moistening her lips with
a damp handkerchief. She couldn&#8217;t understand
why he should be doing this. He was covered with
dust, his coat was torn, and his hand was trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carl,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what&mdash;what&mdash;in the
world&mdash;have you been doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; he trembled.</p>

<p>She tried to raise herself to her elbow but the
effort hurt her. As she fell back again she remembered
distinctly the vision of Carl standing in the
middle of the road and springing for the bit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Then she recalled the whole incident. She looked
anxiously at the dusty figure still bending over
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are hurt?&#8221; she asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My arm,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>She noticed that his left arm hung limply by his
side. She tried again to sit up but her bruised
back forced her down again. She closed her eyes.
Through the dizzy turmoil in her brain one fact
thrust itself forward with acute clearness; Carl had
saved her life. But for him, Aladdin might have
dragged her half a mile. The truth came as something
of a surprise. When she had seen him
standing there, it had not occurred to her that
he would do this. She had only feared lest he
should be trampled down. Instead, he had stood
his ground. She was proud of him. It would be
a pleasure to tell Barnes of this.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re more comfortable,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
back to the house and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Aladdin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After I got you clear, he ran on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll return to the house,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I guess
that&#8217;s all the word they&#8217;ll need.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carl rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better make sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was unsteady. She was quick to perceive it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>&#8220;Sit down here by me, Carl,&#8221; she said, &#8220;they&mdash;they
will come for us.&#8221; He obeyed her. She
noticed that his left arm hung like an empty
sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were very brave, Carl,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The color returned to his cheeks. He looked
down at her with an expression that was quite boyish
in its frank delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any man would be brave for you,&#8221; he said
simply.</p>

<p>She wondered at this. It gave her a new
sense of power and yet she did not smile as she
had when she learned that Barnes had told her
things he had not intended to tell her. Nor did
the power seem so great, though both incidents
opened her eyes to a new personality within her.
And both gave her sense of responsibility which,
while nursing the pride which all responsibility
gives, brought its burden too. In mounting the
throne which was her birthright, she was forced to
assume the duties of a ruler. A queen must take
a sterner oath of allegiance than the humblest of
her subjects.</p>

<p>From the direction of the house, she heard the
clattering hoof beats of a racing horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is coming,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Merriweather?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s Dr.
Merriweather.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carl stepped into the road. In a cloud of dust
a horse and buggy was approaching at a mad gallop.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Joe!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Eleanor smoothed back the hair from her brow
and forced herself to sit up. If a moment before
her face had lacked color it did not now.
With Carl she watched the nearing carriage with
an interest that almost made her forget her
pain.</p>

<p>Barnes drew up the horse with a suddenness
that brought it to its hind legs. Before it had
fairly stopped he had leaped out, run across the
road, and knelt by her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he met her
smile. &#8220;You&#8217;re not badly hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but Carl&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned as though for the first time conscious
that the other was here.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has hurt his arm,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I guess he
saved my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>you</i> are all whole? You aren&#8217;t cut or
broken&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only just bruised,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but Carl&mdash;I&#8217;m
afraid he&#8217;s broken his arm.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Carl had come nearer. Barnes rose and grasped
his sound hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve earned the thanks of us all, old man,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>Carl flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was nothing. We&mdash;we&#8217;ve got to get her
back to the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sent for the doctor,&#8221; said Barnes. &#8220;When
I saw Aladdin come back riderless I knew there
was trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned to the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think you can make your feet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed his arm about her waist and she stood
up. But she could not rest her weight upon her
left ankle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put your arm around my neck,&#8221; he commanded.</p>

<p>She obeyed.</p>

<p>He placed one arm below her and lifting her
clear of the ground bore her to the carriage. Then
with her right foot upon the step she easily clambered
in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you, Carl.&#8221;</p>

<p>The latter took his place by Eleanor&#8217;s side.
Barnes swung the horse about, touched him with
the whip and they galloped back. He sat between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
the two and did not speak again until they reached
the house. Then once more he took her in his
arms and carried her into the house. He carried
her upstairs, though she protested at this, and
lowered her upon her little white bed.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela neither shrieked nor fainted.
In a business-like way she ordered Barnes from the
room and proceeded to disrobe the girl.</p>

<p>By the time Barnes was downstairs again Dr.
Merriweather had arrived. He admitted later that
it was the only time in his life that his horse had
not gone fast enough for him. He went up the
stairs two at a time.</p>

<p>Barnes found Carl, grown a bit faint, in the
living-room. He got cold water for him and then
very gently removed his coat and slit his sleeve to
the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be ready for the doctor when he comes
down,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sure you&#8217;re sound everywhere
else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But Eleanor&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid she&#8217;s hurt
worse than she seemed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in the best of hands now. And Carl&mdash;it
was bully of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;there wasn&#8217;t anything else to do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But we don&#8217;t all do the only thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess anyone would&mdash;with her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;With her?&#8221; exclaimed Barnes. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t
know but what you&#8217;re right. Perhaps we all would&mdash;with
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led him to a sofa and made him lie down.</p>

<p>From above came the imperious tinkle of the
silver bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he goes!&#8221; exclaimed Barnes. &#8220;I wondered
how long it would take him to smell out this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hurried upstairs where he found the old
gentleman upon his elbow, his eyes turned towards
Eleanor&#8217;s room.</p>

<small>WHAT MAKES A PRODIGAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Dr. Merriweather reported that Miss Van Patten
had escaped with nothing worse than bruises and a
wrenched ankle.</p>

<p>&#8220;But by the Lord, Harry!&#8221; he exploded, &#8220;it
was nothing short of a miracle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A miracle?&#8221; questioned Barnes. &#8220;What
about Carl&#8217;s part in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor paused a moment. Then he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carl was the miracle,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>Langdon himself did not get off so easily; his
arm was broken below the elbow and the danger did
not so much lie in the break as in the stiffness
which might result. The doctor did not realize as
fully as Barnes what the sheer nimbleness of those
fingers of the left hand meant to Carl. Like a
good many country physicians, he was greater as
a medical man than as a surgeon. He rather took
this aftermath of a fracture for granted. Consequently
he was a bit surprised at Barnes&#8217; concern
in the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have his arm out of a sling in six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
weeks,&#8221; declared the doctor. &#8220;May be a bit stiff,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; exploded Barnes. &#8220;You&#8217;d
better amputate it and be done with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that if you take his fiddle away from
him, you take away his soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His soul?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. He couldn&#8217;t sing without his fiddle
any more than I could paint without my hands.
What&#8217;s a soul without a song? And he&mdash;he has
some big ones to sing during these next few
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady. Steady. Don&#8217;t let that imagination
of yours run away with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes studied the big-framed, big-faced man a
second and continued more soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you call imagination are the grim facts
of life for him and for me, doctor. His fiddle
isn&#8217;t a detail of his life&mdash;it&#8217;s life itself for him.
Cripple his arm and you cripple his soul. You&#8217;ve
got to fight as hard for those fingers as you would
for his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Dr. Merriweather was at first only annoyed
by what he took to be mere extravagance of speech,
there was something now in the tense face of Barnes
which made him pause and think.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>&#8220;Carl didn&#8217;t say anything to me about that,&#8221; he
observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Barnes, &#8220;because he didn&#8217;t
wish it to get upstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Eleanor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Eleanor,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>Dr. Merriweather held out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;now I understand the
miracle. You&#8217;re a better physician in this household
than I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But when you live here day after day
there are certain things you&#8217;re forced to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if you&#8217;ve diagnosed anything peculiar
about Mr. Van Patten lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes moved uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems better, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything queer about his eyes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed that every time anyone comes into
the room he strains towards him as though trying
to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so. Has it occurred to you that perhaps
he <i>does</i> see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That he can&mdash;actually <i>can</i> see?&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why no!&#8221; exclaimed Barnes. &#8220;Why&mdash;that
doesn&#8217;t seem possible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he continues to pull himself together at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
rate, it&#8217;s coming. All I&#8217;m wondering about is if
he isn&#8217;t even now playing possum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should he do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying that he is, mind you. But it
wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if some day he surprised the
rest of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But look here&mdash;this is serious. If once he
sees me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even then he might not recognize you. He
isn&#8217;t as alert mentally as he used to be; his new
joy in life would force back every doubt; your acceptance
here by Aunt Philomela and Eleanor&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Good Heavens that would mean a terrible
crash in prospect. I can&#8217;t stay on here forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too much for me, my boy,&#8221; the doctor
answered soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if he can see now, why doesn&#8217;t he say
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These old men get strange whims. Perhaps
he&#8217;s waiting to make sure of his sight so as not to
disappoint the others by raising their hope. Or it
may be just an old man&#8217;s joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes smiled. It was something of an ironical
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;If one had the right point of view,&#8221; he remarked,
&#8220;there are several things a man might
think a good joke here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>&#8220;And you,&#8221; answered the doctor with a good-natured
grin, &#8220;are that man, I should say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God it&#8217;s your type of man who&#8217;s
playing this game,&#8221; concluded the doctor.</p>

<p>It was three days before Barnes was allowed to
see Miss Van Patten. On the whole they were
three of the most uncomfortable days he ever
passed. The father demanded more and more of
his time and succeeded, whether deliberately or not,
in a pretty form of torture. He pressed him
harder in his questioning both about Alaska and
about Carl and never withdrew from his face those
closed eyes which still seemed at times to flicker
as though opened the tiniest crack. But that may
have been pure imagination. There are holy
images which if one gazes long enough upon them
appear to move their eyes.</p>

<p>Between his visits to the father Barnes made at
least one daily pilgrimage to Dr. Merriweather&#8217;s for
a short talk with Carl. Here again he submitted
to another kind of torture. Barnes understood
Langdon as no one else on earth understood him,
and this invited from the latter the frankest kind
of confidence. He listened and he suffered.</p>

<p>Back in the house again, he must needs repeat
to Aunt Philomela the greater part of his talk with
Langdon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>&#8220;The dear boy!&#8221; she once exclaimed, &#8220;Eleanor
is under very great obligations to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very great,&#8221; answered Barnes. &#8220;He saved
her life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he&#8217;ll soon be able to come over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; Barnes answered honestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He and Eleanor have always got on so well
together. In all the time they have known one
another they have never quarreled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very well behaved of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see&mdash;&#8221; she concluded significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he assured her hastily, &#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>During those three days, then, Barnes played
his part like a good actor&mdash;fulfilled his duty like
a good soldier, but he lived in dreary isolation.
Aunt Philomela saw no change in him. If she had,
it would have been some satisfaction to her. As it
was they dined in solemn t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te and disagreed
upon every topic proposed for conversation&mdash;except
Carl. If anything, Barnes&#8217; meek acquiescence
on this subject irritated her more than an
aggressive attitude on his part would have done.
It was altogether too noticeable not to excite her
suspicion. But for once she kept her counsel and
waited.</p>

<p>It was on the fourth morning that, as she was
rising from the breakfast table, she announced,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>&#8220;My niece wished me to tell you that she will
see you for a few minutes this morning if you care
to come up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes caught his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you waited all this time before you told
me!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is hardly ready at this moment to see you,&#8221;
she observed haughtily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes did not finish. What he was going to say
was that by delaying the news she had deprived
him by just so much of anticipation. On second
thought he realized that this would probably not
make her feel so badly as it did him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Aunt Philomela,&#8221; he returned with
dignity, &#8220;kindly convey my compliments to your
niece and tell her I shall be pleased to pay my
respects at any time she may suggest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which means I suppose that you&#8217;ll come up
at about eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At about eleven,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>It took the tall clock in the library almost a day
to compass the arc between eight and eleven but it
was finally accomplished. Before the clock had
ceased striking Barnes was on his way upstairs.
He was met at the door by Aunt Philomela who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
escorted him to her sitting-room where Eleanor lay
upon a couch looking not one whit worse for her
adventure. The color in her cheeks was even deeper
if anything; her eyes full and lustrous, if a bit
startled; and her hand-clasp firm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems silly to lie here,&#8221; she smiled, &#8220;but
between Aunt Philomela and Dr. Merriweather,
what can one do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;One might as well be
in the hands of Fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took a chair at the head of the couch and
Aunt Philomela picking up a bit of lace upon
which she was at work sat by the window and
proceeded still further to symbolize Fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been very dull in Alaska these last three
days,&#8221; he observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Alaska?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Downstairs is Alaska,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Aunty says that between father and Carl,
you&#8217;ve been very busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a great many things to think about,&#8221;
he admitted. &#8220;One of them concerns your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela glanced up from her knitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he nodded, &#8220;it may be necessary for
me to make my excuses and leave before very
long.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; demanded Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that Mr. Van Patten is getting very
much better. I mean that he may see more than
we think he sees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His eyesight is returning?&#8221; exclaimed the girl,
&#8220;Oh, that is too good to be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His eyesight,&#8221; gasped Aunt Philomela flushing
red, &#8220;you mean&mdash;you mean he may yet detect
us in this fraud?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For all I know he may already have done so,&#8221;
answered Barnes.</p>

<p>The girl rose to her elbow. Aunt Philomela
looked upon the point of jumping from the window.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed,&#8221; stammered the latter, &#8220;that
he has made me very uncomfortable these last few
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be only your conscience,&#8221; suggested
Barnes. &#8220;But I&mdash;I have no conscience and yet
he has made <i>me</i> very uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Merriweather knows this?&#8221; asked the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has suspected it. He left it for me to tell
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it would be like getting Dad home from
a foreign land,&#8221; cried the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;He would be almost like another prodigal,&#8221;
smiled Barnes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>&#8220;Only,&#8221; she objected, &#8220;father has not wasted
his substance in riotous living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t what makes the prodigal,&#8221; answered
Barnes. &#8220;The prodigal needn&#8217;t be really prodigal.
It&#8217;s the journey away from home into the far
country that makes the prodigal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You take great liberty with the Scriptures,&#8221;
snapped Aunt Philomela more to relieve her feelings
than anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like every artist,&#8221; answered Barnes unruffled,
&#8220;I have learned the Bible almost by heart. Do
you remember what the father exclaimed when he
saw his son?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela pretended to resume her knitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you can quote it,&#8221; suggested Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps <i>you</i> will,&#8221; put in the girl to save her
aunt&#8217;s feelings.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said,&#8221; resumed Barnes, slowly. &#8220;He said,
&#8216;This my son was dead, and is alive again; he was
lost, and he is found.&#8217; Nothing about riotous living.
The boy had gone away and came back again.
That was all that counted. That is all that will
count when Mr. Van Patten comes back from the
darkness to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So in his own life, he thought, his father was as
much the prodigal as he, the son, was. But he said
nothing of this.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>&#8220;If it should be true!&#8221; stammered the girl
again.</p>

<p>She lost sight of all the complications this
involved&mdash;lost sight of all the other complications
which had worried her before Barnes came upstairs
with this news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunty,&#8221; she determined, &#8220;I must go in at once
and see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Barnes motioned her to lie down again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he advised, &#8220;let&#8217;s determine first
what is best to be done. Aunt Philomela&mdash;what
do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say it&#8217;s all a pretty pickle,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do <i>you</i> say?&#8221; asked Eleanor.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; answered Barnes. &#8220;First of all, I must
leave before he recognizes me. Secondly, we must
get his real son back to him as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed the girl. &#8220;But will Joe come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall send him a wire every day until he does
come,&#8221; said Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when he does come, what will Carl say?&#8221;
demanded Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>Barnes smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I fear he will
be somewhat embarrassed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten looked troubled. Here was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
another uncomfortable situation to add to the long
list of which Barnes was either the direct or indirect
cause. She looked at him with what he interpreted
as an appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps that isn&#8217;t a very important matter anyway,&#8221;
he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Important,&#8221; snapped Aunt Philomela, &#8220;I should
call it very important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; inquired Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because my niece and Mr. Langdon are
engaged,&#8221; she exploded.</p>

<small>BARNES LEARNS A GREAT TRUTH</small></h2>
</div>

<p>If Barnes had tried to paint Eleanor as she looked
that moment, he certainly would have had to dip
his brush in damson preserves. She turned upon
her aunt with a little cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunty, you know, for father&#8217;s sake, we decided
it was best not to say anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s high time,&#8221; she stormed back, &#8220;that some
of us spoke out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes leaned forward. He extended his hand
to the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I congratulate&mdash;Carl,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She took his hand weakly and he rose. He
stared about the room a second as though uncertain
just what to do or say next. Aunt Philomela,
who had assumed a very rigid pose, relaxed at the
sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I thought you suspected as much anyway,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes&mdash;I did. Mr. Van Patten spoke of
it&mdash;Carl spoke of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl glanced up quickly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>&#8220;Carl said he had secured your consent,&#8221; she
observed coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a brother I advised him as best I could,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;But when&mdash;when did he see
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He came over this morning&mdash;against the doctor&#8217;s
advice,&#8221; put in Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; concluded Barnes, a bit inanely, &#8220;I
must be going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon the words he started for the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;You still think that it&mdash;it is best for you to
leave father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure of that now,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>Barnes was not one to put off acting upon a
resolution. He went down the hall at once, and
finding Mr. Van Patten awake put the matter to
him as gently as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I must go away for a little
while&mdash;perhaps for a week or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Away?&#8221; gasped the old man. &#8220;Again?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was genuine emotion in the old man&#8217;s
cry. It was a father&#8217;s cry and it created in Barnes
an overwhelming desire for his own. In something
of a vision he seemed to see the old proprietor
of the Acme echoing this need for <i>his</i> son.
The little comedy had turned serious. From acting
the prodigal he found himself feeling the prodigal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
He wanted to get back home&mdash;not as represented
by the Waldemere, but as embodied in the
flesh and blood of those whose name he bore. So
it happened that the more this aged gentleman upon
the bed expressed the need for a son, the more
he stirred in Barnes the need of a father. Barnes
turned away his head from the searching blind
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only for a little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little while? My son, I&#8217;m living now by
only little whiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting stronger every day,&#8221; said
Barnes. &#8220;I want to see you sitting up when I
come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Barnes, earnestly. &#8220;Life is
beginning new, in more ways than one, for all
of us here. Your happiest days are coming. If
you&#8217;ll hold tight till I get back, I&#8217;ll prove
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; he answered submissively.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must do more than that. You must fight.
Will you promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, boy, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll write to you every day. I&#8217;m only going
as far as New York.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>&#8220;All right, Joe. Then&mdash;perhaps you had better
start right off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two weeks; perhaps less. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man took his hand. Barnes bent over
him and kissed his forehead. Then he went out
of the room and back to Eleanor. Here again he
saw no reason for delay. In reply to his knock she
bade him come in. She was sitting alone in the
same position as when he had left her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told your father,&#8221; he said without preamble,
&#8220;and now I&#8217;ve come to say good-by to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve told Daddy&mdash;already?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He bore it very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so hasty,&#8221; she stammered. &#8220;You take
away one&#8217;s breath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some things are best done hastily,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this&mdash;why, Aunt Philomela is quite
broken up at the idea of your leaving. She&mdash;she
has had to lie down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll not disturb her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;you must. She would never forgive
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked as though about to call, but he
checked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must tell you first my plan. If it&#8217;s possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
to get a wire through to the boy, I shall do
it. If, in the meanwhile, you yourself hear anything
from him, you must let me know at once.
I&#8217;ll leave my address.&#8221; He took a card from his
pocket and handed it to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so very kind,&#8221; she murmured, with a
break in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall write your father every day,&#8221; he went
on, &#8220;so perhaps he will not ask many questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will read the letters to him myself,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>He caught his breath. It was a commonplace
enough remark but he grasped at it like a
compliment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he answered simply.</p>

<p>Certainly that in itself was a commonplace
enough reply, and yet it turned her cheeks scarlet.</p>

<p>When he spoke again it was very deliberately,
as though the words really had some profound
meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m able to get hold of Joe,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
myself shall come back with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;that would be so
helpful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my one hope,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>Then, because there was so much more that he
wanted to say; then, because there was so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
he mustn&#8217;t say, he turned his eyes towards Aunt
Philomela&#8217;s room. The girl obeyed his unexpressed
desire in some haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunty,&#8221; she called.</p>

<p>She came in, a bit frightened. Certainly in appearance
she bore out the girl&#8217;s statement. All the
fight seemed to have gone from her. She was an
Aunt Philomela he had never seen before. She
was scarcely more than a sweet, lovable old lady
who looked very dependent. She came forward
uncertainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going?&#8221; she exclaimed, in as much
astonishment as though this were the first she had
heard of it.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must start at once. I&#8217;m going to walk to
Chester to catch the noon train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ll send John with you,&#8221; she stammered.</p>

<p>He smiled at the recollection this suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but I still prefer to
walk. I shall not forget&mdash;this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten glanced at him with a queer
little smile about her mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;what are we going to do?&#8221; asked Aunt
Philomela turning to her niece.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must do the best we can,&#8221; answered Miss
Van Patten.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. It will leave us
quite alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is Carl,&#8221; suggested Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; answered Aunt Philomela, &#8220;I forgot.
There is Carl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I find Joe I may come back for a few days,&#8221;
explained Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come back for a visit anyway, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221; asked Aunt Philomela, brightening.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I find Joe,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>Here again the girl caught an almost formidable
note.</p>

<p>The little old lady moved uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must thank you for all you&#8217;ve done,&#8221; she
faltered, almost as though this were an apology.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t thank me,&#8221; he insisted.</p>

<p>At this opportune moment John entered with a
cup of broth for Miss Van Patten.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; requested Barnes, as the man put down
the cup and was upon the point of leaving, &#8220;will
you be good enough to pack my bag?&#8221;</p>

<p>John looked surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>He paused, coughed, and then blurted out,</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I have a moment with you, sir, before
you leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Barnes&#8217; turn to look surprised.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>&#8220;Why&mdash;yes,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>Barnes turned again to Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have lost some of your color,&#8221; he said
unexpectedly. &#8220;Would you mind if I gave you
some good advice?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked bewildered but she shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just this,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;don&#8217;t worry
over your accounts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>She spoke so mildly that the girl smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;For,&#8221; he went on didactically, &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing
so bad for the nerves as modern business
methods.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little old lady glanced up to see if he were
smiling. He was not. He never was when she
suspected him of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll never get them straightened
out again,&#8221; she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better for you,&#8221; he assured her.
&#8220;What you really ought to do, Aunt Philomela, is
to take up gambling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>He nodded blandly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I ever have the opportunity I&#8217;ll teach you
draw poker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The least anyone can do at my age is to refrain
from acquiring bad habits,&#8221; she answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>&#8220;On the contrary, your age is the only safe age
in which to indulge in them,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;Nothing
keeps one so young as the element of uncertainty.
That is why I recommend gambling.
But you can gamble a little, even with your accounts;
you can let them run so that you will
never quite know where you stand. Some such
excitement would brace you up wonderfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; she observed, with something of her
old-time scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;You made a good beginning,&#8221; he suggested,
&#8220;when you bought into &#8216;The Lucky Find.&#8217; Mining
stocks are always a good gamble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Lucky Find&#8217; wasn&#8217;t even a good
gamble,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>John entered with the dress-suit case. Barnes
extended his hand to the little old lady. He was
a believer in abrupt departures. He disliked the
inclined plane of inanities usually accompanying
a farewell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Au revoir, Aunt Philomela,&#8221; he said simply.</p>

<p>The little old lady took his hand. Her fingers
were trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you have been very kind,&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, Eleanor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He turned, and John followed him to the Dutch
door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; began John, &#8220;I&#8217;d just like to ask
you once more about &#8216;The Lucky Find.&#8217; You are
still interested in it, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Extremely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you advise me to hold the stock, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d advise you to hold it for two weeks,&#8221; answered
Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir. Thank you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;ll be at least one more dividend,&#8221;
he assured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very good, sir. Good luck to you,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank <i>you</i>,&#8221; Barnes answered earnestly. &#8220;I
need everyone to wish me Good Luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hurried down the path and turned into the
road. It had drunk of the sun so long that it
was more saffron than ever. And yet what a
groveling creature it was! It licked the feet of
the houses by its side. What, after all, were the
houses? Mere shelters for men. What of these
men with their strong legs and the arrogant pose
of their heads? The eyes of the women bade them
stay and they stayed; bade them go, and they
went. Neither the road nor the houses nor the
strong-rayed sun could countermand that order.
Men went to wars, they went to sea, they pushed
through forests, they dared the icy mountains of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
the North&mdash;for what? Gold? Bah! Where did
the gold go, murmured the women who remained
behind smiling to themselves? For fame? Who
gave them fame questioned the deep eyes of the
women? For selfish pleasure? Wherein lay the
pleasure until it shone in the eyes of these same
women? The road, then, was no worse than the
men, and both were a convenience for the women
who lived in the houses.</p>

<p>That was all. Barnes saw it clearly enough now.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>SO DOES HIS MOTHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Horatio G. Barnes was sitting in lonely
grandeur in the drawing-room of her suite at the
Waldemere listlessly watching the scant life which
crawled along the hot macadamized road below her.
She was a tall woman with a serious face which on
the whole was really beautiful. Her wistful gray
eyes were set between rather high cheek bones and
above a nose and mouth wonderfully well formed
if a trifle masculine. The warm glow of her fine
skin and her abundant white hair relieved them of
prominence. She was tastefully dressed in black
and wore no jewels save a single large stone guarded
by her wedding ring.</p>

<p>The high semi-formal room in which she sat
seemed no part of her. She looked as though she had
stepped in here as into the waiting-room of one of the
more pretentious hotels. In spite of the luxuriousness
and the fairly good taste which she had forced
upon her surroundings, she rose superior to them.
They were too new to match the centuries which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
still lingered in her eyes; they were too obvious to
match the quiet reserve of her own manner.</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes from the brass-trimmed touring
car which slid by on the street below and raised
them to the stark blue sky above. The strong family
resemblance to her son was then obvious. Her
eyes were the same which Barnes had raised to the
cotton-blossom clouds. In them there was the same
yearning for expression. But the mouth was different;
there was no trace here of that shrewd humor
which characterized Richard&#8217;s; nothing but the set
capacity for infinite endurance. It was the mouth of
a warrior mother. But as the sky gave her imaginings
the freedom to roam a world common to her
son, her lips grew tender.</p>

<p>She wondered what the boy might be doing at that
moment. Perhaps he was sitting by the roadside
sketching; perhaps admiring the work of other
sketchers in that gallery of which he had spoken in
one letter. She wondered if the money she sent
him, had safely reached him. It might be as well
to send him more if she didn&#8217;t hear from him by to-morrow.
She might even make a flying trip down
there to see what he was about. But there was
Horatio. She realized that her husband&#8217;s sole pleasure
at the end of those hot days lay in finding her
waiting for him here. He had not seemed as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
as usual during this last week. Though he never
spoke of it, she suspected that he was missing the
boy. At night he tossed uneasily and once she had
heard him murmur &#8220;Richard&#8221; in his troubled
dreams.</p>

<p>It was too bad that in spite of his disappointment
at losing an heir to his business throne, that he
could not understand. Not all men were created
with the same ambitions. He himself had left
the farm in which his father had taken such pride.
If then her boy wished to paint pictures&mdash;</p>

<p>She started as she felt a pair of arms about her
neck. Looking around she found a brown face next
to hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick,&#8221; she cried breathless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Home again, mother,&#8221; he assured her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Home,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard you
say home for years, Dick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Dad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the office,&#8221; she answered sadly. &#8220;He has
missed you, Dick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come back&mdash;like a prodigal,&#8221; he answered,
kissing her, &#8220;but I&#8217;m not repentant. I&#8217;m
going to have a talk with Dad to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked a bit frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;But first,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a talk with you. Put on
your mildest bonnet and we&#8217;ll take a walk in the
park.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>Without delay she obeyed and stepped with him
into the elevator. It was with some pride that she
passed through the office by the side of her tall son;
it was with a renewed vision of life that she walked
with him along the hot street and over the familiar
course they had footed together so many times. She
noticed with further pride that several passers-by
glanced twice at them. She did not realize that this
might have been prompted somewhat by her son&#8217;s
costume which, in contrast to her own modish dress
and that of the other pedestrians, was strikingly
picturesque. He still wore his dusty walking-boots,
his flannel shirt and loose tie. With his brown skin
and erect bearing he looked like a soldier home on
a furlough from active service.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes they reached the park which
was associated more intimately with his life than
any other spot in New York. For it was here that
she used to bring him as a child, as a schoolboy,
and finally whenever he came home from college.
It was here that the first discussions took place on
Art versus the Acme; it was here that she threshed
out her own conflict of duty to her son and duty to
her husband. Until now she had felt that she had
failed miserably in attempting to harmonize the
hawthorn in her blood with the pine in her husband&#8217;s.
But to-day there was that in her son&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
bearing which seemed to give her fresh hope. So
they came to their favorite seat and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he began abruptly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve learned a
great deal in this last week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hinted about your big picture. You have
it nearly done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t begun it yet&mdash;on canvas,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounded very attractive as you described it,&#8221;
she encouraged.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderful subject,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s much easier to paint a landscape
than&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. She finished for him,</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A young woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment. Then, without
looking at him, she rested her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about her, Dick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had thought of using a big canvas and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about <i>her</i>, Dick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That my boy will never be content with a mere
picture of her,&#8221; she interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, you&#8217;re a wizard,&#8221; he declared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; she answered almost a bit sadly. &#8220;It
is she who is now the wizard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is her eyes,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Her eyes, her
nose, her mouth, her chin, her hair&mdash;her soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gently patted his arm still without looking
at him. Her own eyes had grown wistful as though
in fixing her gaze upon the sunshine which sprinkled
through the leaf-shadows she was bidding
something good-by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me from the first day, Dick,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>So he began with the sobbing by the letter-box
and took her hour by hour through the events of
the succeeding days, trying hard to make her see
as vividly as possible every detail of them. But
when he had concluded, she had clearly in her
mind but one picture&mdash;that of a young woman
painted in a bewildering combination of black and
gold and damson preserves. And this woman met
her eyes with something of a challenge. She continued
to pat her son&#8217;s arm silently and very
gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;So there she stands,&#8221; he ran on, &#8220;and every
path in this old park seems to lead to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not notice the quick flash in his mother&#8217;s
eyes, followed by a deepened look of patient resignation.
He did not know that he was hurting her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
He did not know that he was making this park a
foreign place to her.</p>

<p>He lowered his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;And back there too is Langdon. Mother, do
you think I was a fool to leave him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what else you could do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only that a man has a right to fight for his
own&mdash;giving and taking no quarter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she isn&#8217;t your own, Dick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;that&#8217;s true. And yet
she&#8217;s already so big a part of me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one other thing I wanted to see you
about. I ought to settle down now into some sort
of definite work. I might get some sort of a teaching
position, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered quickly. &#8220;There&#8217;s no need
of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s always the Acme.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor the Acme either,&#8221; she said decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But here I am twenty-five years old&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick,&#8221; she interrupted with some concern, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want to see you change. She would not wish
to see you change. You&#8217;ll paint good pictures
some day. Promise me you&#8217;ll not say anything to
your father about coming into his business. Promise
that to me and&mdash;to her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>&#8220;Why are you so serious about it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a serious matter. Will you promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The world is changing for you, Dick,&#8221; she hurried
on, &#8220;and the thing to do now is to hold fast to
your true self. Don&#8217;t let the world change <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was soon off again on another panegyric.
She listened with her face grown tender but with
that same far away look in her eyes. So they sat
until the evening shadows began to creep in and
she bethought herself of her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be good to him, Dick,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;He has
missed you. I think he&#8217;s changed some in this
last week. I heard him say once that he might go
back to the old farm for a visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great,&#8221; exclaimed Barnes. &#8220;If we can keep
that idea in his head, we&#8217;ll make a man of him
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what he ought to do&mdash;go back
there and stay. He ought to live a while now.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they were returning, she said, for the first
time able to disentangle from his narrative a strand
other than that of the girl herself,</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad, Dick, that you had an opportunity
to ease the other father. It was a deed worthy of
you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>&#8220;Ah, if you could see him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet I think even if blind I should have
known my own,&#8221; she mused.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mothers know more than anyone else in
the world,&#8221; he replied, taking her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you did it, Dick,&#8221; she said again.
&#8220;It may in some way have had its effect upon your
own father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting mystical.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she protested, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve never seen him
so concerned with matters outside the&mdash;Acme.
He&#8217;s quite changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I tell him about this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Let me tell him,&#8221; she said gently.</p>

<p>She looked up at him proudly. After all, he
was hers. If anyone chose to care a great deal
about him, why, that other was only caring for her
boy. Even if he cared a great deal about someone
else, it was still her boy who was caring.</p>

<p>They reached the Waldemere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barnes has been inquiring for you,&#8221; announced
the clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been to walk with my son,&#8221; she informed
him.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>AN OLD PRODIGAL COMES HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Barnes retired that night with uneasy foreboding,
leaving father and son together. As she
went out, she patted her son&#8217;s shoulder and stooping
pressed her lips against his light hair.</p>

<p>Horatio Barnes watched her until the curtains
closed behind her, and then faced his son determinedly.
He was taller than the latter and heavier.
His smooth-shaven face was pale and clouded. A
physician would have noted many little danger
signals. His expression was that of a man who
has summoned all his reserve strength to some
grim crisis. Barnes was surprised at the change
which had taken place even in the short time he
had been away. Aggressiveness had degenerated
into petulance; self-confidence into bull-headedness.
Yet below all this he saw an outcropping of sentiment
which surprised him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; demanded the father, lighting a black
cigar, &#8220;what do you propose to do now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paint,&#8221; answered Barnes, &#8220;harder than ever.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>The father scowled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you had enough of that yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the mother, the two had avoided this
subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Barnes answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m just awaking to
the possibilities in Art.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father chewed his cigar a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy,&#8221; he said finally, &#8220;this business here is
getting too big for me alone. I can&#8217;t hold on much
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then chuck it,&#8221; advised Barnes.</p>

<p>For another minute the father silently chewed his
cigar. He kept control of himself because to do
so meant just one chance of keeping control of this
business.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Acme,&#8221; he resumed with an effort, &#8220;needs
Youth. It needs someone who can put in twenty
hours a day and not come to the office the next
morning with a twitching face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What it needs, then,&#8221; suggested Barnes, &#8220;is
a man of cast-iron&mdash;with a scroll on his forehead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big business,&#8221; went on the father with
unexpected calmness. &#8220;It&#8217;s a business to be proud
of. It&#8217;s a business that a young man would take
over with forty years already put into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; exclaimed Barnes, &#8220;isn&#8217;t that
enough of good red years to feed into cook-stoves?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>Barnes, Sr., rose to his feet. He paced the
room once or twice. He looked like a man fighting
off bankruptcy. Barnes pitied him&mdash;pitied him
from the bottom of his heart. But that was no
reason why he should help him to his doom.</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; exclaimed the father, taking a stand
directly in front of the boy, &#8220;I wonder how you
ever happened to be a son of mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> a son of yours,&#8221; answered Barnes, coolly,
&#8220;but I am no son of the Acme&#8217;s. Sit down, father.
Don&#8217;t tear yourself to pieces. Let me make a
proposition of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed his hands upon his father&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; he said soberly, &#8220;I want you to take up
Art.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes, Sr., met his son&#8217;s eyes a moment in
astonished stupefication. Then he sank weakly into
his chair. Which left Barnes standing with the
appearance of occupying the superior position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; he ran on, &#8220;I&#8217;m serious. This damned
business of the Acme must be stopped. You&#8217;ve
sat in your office down there until you&#8217;re baked as
dry as though you had been sitting in one of your
own ovens. It&#8217;s burning the soul out of you.
I&#8217;ve seen these last few days just how small at
best a cook-stove is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The older man made no reply, but his lips began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
to twitch. Barnes seated himself before those
twitching lips and resumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been down where people live. Dad, I&#8217;ve
been back on a farm&mdash;just such another farm as
gave you the strength to be alive to-day in spite of
the way you&#8217;ve misused your strength. I&#8217;ve been
back where trees count for something and where
the blue sky is a big item of return for the day&#8217;s
work. I&#8217;ve been back where you still see the sun
in the daytime and the stars at night. I&#8217;ve been
with an old man who expected to have to leave
those things&mdash;who would then have given every
cent he had to stay another day in the midst of it.
If you had strewn cook-stoves end to end across
the continent, he would not have swapped five
breaths of night air for the whole of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man scowled up at him as though wondering
if he had lost his reason.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to have taken you along on that walk
with me,&#8221; ran on Barnes, reminiscently. &#8220;It would
have shown you what life can mean. You ought
to have stood on the hill with me and watched the
cotton-blossom clouds. It would have helped you
understand that look in mother&#8217;s eyes which puzzles
you every time you boast of another hundred
thousand. You think you are rich and powerful.
But listen to this; you haven&#8217;t money enough in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
all your banks to buy one minute of that single
week of me. You think I&#8217;ve been idle, but
let me give you an inventory: five minutes on a
hill-top&mdash;value five thousand dollars; ten minutes
by a letter-box&mdash;value ten thousand dollars;
a half hour with Aunt Philomela&mdash;value thirty
thousand dollars; an hour by a trout stream&mdash;value
one hundred thousand dollars; an hour in
the library, value&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah, you&#8217;re a fool!&#8221; broke in Barnes, Sr.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll submit to any jury who&#8217;s the greater
fool&mdash;you or I,&#8221; answered Barnes, calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye think you can live on such dream money
as that?&#8221; demanded the father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better than you are living on what you have,&#8221;
declared his son.</p>

<p>He paused a minute and then added soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My capital would buy for mother what you
haven&#8217;t been able to buy with yours. It wouldn&#8217;t
leave her in June staring out of a window at a
macadamized road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded the father, straightening
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t leave her to sit alone and wonder
when you&#8217;re going to drop with apoplexy,&#8221; he went
on calmly.</p>

<p>He was almost brutal, and he knew it. It seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the only way. To drive a new fact into that steel-chilled
brain one had to use a sledge hammer. And
Barnes realized that it was now or never.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you think your mother is not happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; answered Barnes, &#8220;figure it out for
yourself. Mother came from a green land&mdash;a land
where even the fences are made of hawthorn;
where even in the heart of London the sheep still
nibble the grass; where acres of green grass are
within walking distance of the Bank of England.
The love of open spaces is in her blood. Yet
you&#8217;ve taken her and shut her up here in this
damned cage, and here you leave her all day long,
only to come home at night with your face twitching.
She isn&#8217;t doing any grumbling. She is isn&#8217;t
that kind. I&#8217;ve never heard a word of complaint
out of her. But I&#8217;ve eyes that aren&#8217;t covered up
with sheet iron. When I saw her to-day I felt like
helping her escape as though she were in prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you giving her?&#8221; demanded Barnes,
pressing home his point. &#8220;Only this,&#8221; he answered,
waving his hand about the apartments.
&#8220;And yet she&#8217;s kept your books for you and stood
by you for forty years. You remember your own
boyhood. I&#8217;ve heard you tell about those fair days
back on the farm. Why don&#8217;t you give her a bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
of that to remember? Why don&#8217;t you chuck a few
flowers and a ray of sunshine into her life? I&#8217;ve
given her more than you have, myself; I&#8217;ve taken
her out in the park. Why don&#8217;t you take her back
to the best days of your life? It&#8217;s time you had
a honeymoon. It&#8217;s time you lifted her face to the
dew. It&#8217;s time you let the sun beat down upon her
a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father had dropped his cigar. He fixed his
worried eyes upon his son. He looked as though
he were stunned. Barnes lowered his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to see this, Dad,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I
want you to see it for her sake and your sake. I
don&#8217;t think we have grown very far apart&mdash;you
and I. If I&#8217;m not the son of your brain, I&#8217;m the
son of your heart. I&#8217;ve been sitting by the side of
an old man and he made me see that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father met his boy&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It hurt to have you go, Dick,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was an act of Providence,&#8221; declared the
latter. &#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t, we might have gone on this
way until&mdash;it was too late to do anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To do anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late for you to take up Art.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father glanced up with the old evil spirit
again in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go back to that,&#8221; he pleaded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>&#8220;Why not? That&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve got to do. And
after all, you&#8217;re an artist in your own way. Look
at the scroll on the Acme doors! Look at your
stand against the Union! That was a stroke of art.
Art is nothing but independence. Art is nothing
but being yourself&mdash;expressing yourself. You&#8217;ve
done that consistently whenever you&#8217;ve really been
yourself. You didn&#8217;t stop to consider how much
you were going to lose in shekels when you told the
crowd you&#8217;d go busted by yourself rather than make
a fortune under them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Horatio Barnes smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one but a true artist could have done that,&#8221;
insisted the son. &#8220;Any other would have reckoned
the cost and swallowed the pill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I beat &#8217;em,&#8221; chuckled the father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Art beats every time,&#8221; declared Barnes. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the one thing a man may pin his faith to. But
that wasn&#8217;t your biggest piece of work as an artist.
You transcended that. You really proved yourself
when you married mother. It was then that you
were true to your highest standard, because then you
were truest to yourself. You could have married
a fortune had you chosen and saved yourself twenty
years of hard work. You could have married old
Arbuckle&#8217;s daughter and placed the Acme where it is
to-day two decades ago. Are you sorry you didn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>&#8220;Sorry!&#8221; exploded the father. &#8220;Your mother,
sir, is worth more to me than all the money in the
Bank of England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she is. That&#8217;s bully of you, Dad.
And you&#8217;ve lived up to that. You&#8217;ve fought for
Art in fighting for her against Lord Dunnington
and all his caddish tribe. Like any good artist,
you&#8217;d sacrifice every round dollar to make her stand
well before them. That isn&#8217;t business, it&#8217;s Art.
It&#8217;s living up to your ideal against all the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; protested the father, &#8220;that isn&#8217;t painting
pictures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord forgive your blindness, Dad,&#8221; Barnes exclaimed.
&#8220;Painting pictures is only one little way
of expressing yourself. A man may be a great
artist without ever having held a brush. A man
may be a great artist in song, in verse, in prose,
in life, even in business. But in business you
mustn&#8217;t forget that back of it lies life. That&#8217;s
where you slipped up. You forgot that you&#8217;re
here to live&mdash;to give life to Mother, your masterpiece.
To be sure, I&#8217;ve chosen to paint pictures.
That seemed to me the only way in which I could
live up to my best. But that doesn&#8217;t make me any
better or worse than you. The whole game is to
get broad and big through whatever you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why shouldn&#8217;t I stick to business?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>&#8220;Because you aren&#8217;t getting big; because you&#8217;ve
gone stale. You need a change.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes, Sr., shifted in his chair. He reached
for his cigar-box. That was a good sign.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know but what you&#8217;re right, Dick,&#8221;
he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it, Dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought lately that it&mdash;it wouldn&#8217;t be
bad to take your mother back to the old place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do it! Do it!&#8221; exclaimed Barnes. &#8220;Make up
your mind to-night. Decide before you go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means giving up opening a&mdash;London
office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve too many offices already. Cut &#8217;em
down. Tell mother you&#8217;re thinking of taking a
rest, and you&#8217;ll see her grow ten years younger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think that she&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the question was answered by the mother herself
who stole through the door in her dressing-gown.
Her cheeks were pale with worry. In negligee she
appeared so much older and tired that Barnes was
startled. He crossed to her side, placed an arm
about her waist, and led her to his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, mother?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. Only&mdash;it&#8217;s very late. What have
you two been talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask Dad,&#8221; he replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>She turned her worried eyes upon her husband.
The latter too saw for the first time the years in
his wife&#8217;s face. He quailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horatio,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;what&#8217;s the matter? Are
you ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>He roused himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wife,&#8221; he said, rising to his feet. &#8220;Wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed an arm about her. He threw back his
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wife,&#8221; he announced with emphasis, &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to take up Art!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE BLIND SEE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Barnes was awakened the next morning by a
gentle tap at his door. He thought it was John.
But, in answer to his response, his mother entered.
She looked as fresh as a girl of twenty. Her face
was radiant. She crossed swiftly to his bedside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Dicky boy,&#8221; she cried joyously, &#8220;there&#8217;s
been a miracle! The prodigal father has come back
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miracle?&#8221; questioned Barnes, patting her hand.
&#8220;What about my part in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you,&#8221; exclaimed the mother, &#8220;you&#8217;re the
miracle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes smiled. It was just so Dr. Merriweather
had answered him when he had put a similar question
about Carl. He was learning something about
how miracles are performed. It seemed as though
if you loved mightily it was possible to accomplish
most anything. And yet, in the supreme undertaking
of his life, where he had loved most, he had
lost. All night long he had wondered about this.</p>

<p>At this moment Horatio Barnes himself strided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
in, dressed in a bath-robe and slippers that wouldn&#8217;t
stay on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Morning, Dick,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
keep a herd of Jerseys. In the old days Mitchell
used to beat us all hollow on stock, but I&#8217;ll have
some this time that will make his eyes stick out.
I hope there are a few Mitchells left to watch me
carry off the blue ribbons. Suppose they still hold
the County Fair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t a doubt of it,&#8221; answered Barnes,
enthusiastically, &#8220;but I&#8217;m afraid we won&#8217;t be able
to get in for it this Fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t?&#8221; snorted the father. &#8220;How much time
do you want? I&#8217;ll have a herd within a week or
know the reason why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, steady,&#8221; his son cautioned. &#8220;Remember
there are tenants on the old farm at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll move &#8217;em out bag and baggage within a
month. I&#8217;ll do it if it costs twenty thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew,&#8221; whistled Barnes, &#8220;but when you do
make up your mind&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wait,&#8221; answered the senior. &#8220;There&#8217;s
another thing I want settled right off. I&#8217;m going
to start a close corporation for the promotion of
Art. I&#8217;ll appoint myself president of the company
and make you vice-president, treasurer, secretary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
and general manager on a salary of five thousand a
year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our offices will be on the farm. I&#8217;ll touch up
the fences, while you attend to the sunsets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a joke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by a good deal,&#8221; snorted Barnes, Sr. &#8220;If
you&#8217;re in for that sort of thing, I&#8217;m going for
once to put it on a paying basis. If you&#8217;ll paint
your mother as she looks this minute, I&#8217;ll pay you
ten thousand cash for the job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes turned towards her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I can do it,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but
I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s a bargain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bargain,&#8221; answered Barnes, gripping his
father&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>That morning Barnes sent off a second telegram
to Joe. It read,</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a case of life or death. Come home.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_264.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Do you remember,&#8221; he asked gently, &#8220;what I told you<br />
about the true adventurers?&#8221;<br />


<span class="indentleft"><i>See page <a href="#Page_328">328</a></i></span></p>


<p>Then he sat down to write a letter to the other
father and through the father to Her. She had said
that she would read these letters herself. Her
hands would hold the paper; her eyes would scan
the script; her lips would utter the words. If
the waiting father were able to do nothing more,
Barnes thanked him for this priceless privilege of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
thus indirectly furnishing him the means for talking
a bit each day with Her.</p>

<p>The letters were necessarily vague and rambling.
Barnes spoke mysteriously of business, of men seen
and others to be seen, of the necessity of waiting here
for word from one who he hoped in the end would
relieve him of all his mining ventures.</p>

<p>&#8220;I await a reply, which should reach me any day
now,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;When it arrives, I&#8217;ll come back.
Give my love to Aunt Philomela and to Eleanor.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was two days later that he received an answer
in Eleanor&#8217;s own handwriting. At sight of the envelope
he felt for a moment as though all his wildest
dreams had come true&mdash;as though he were to find
within all that he hungered to hear from her. But
it turned out to be nothing but a quiet gossipy letter
about Aunt Philomela and of course chiefly about
her father. He was improving daily, and Dr.
Merriweather was now quite sure he was to recover
his sight. He spent all his waking hours in talking
of his boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she concluded, &#8220;Joe <i>must</i> come home now.
Not even you could save Daddy from the blow which
would follow should the boy refuse. I am waiting
every minute for a telegram from him. With a heart
full of gratitude to you, I remain, sincerely yours,
Eleanor Van Patten.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>That day Barnes sat in the park from lunch to
sunset with his mother. Both he and she agreed
that the only significant feature of the letter was
that it contained no mention of Carl.</p>

<p>So a restless week passed, the most important
incident of which, outside his daily letter from
Eleanor, was the fact that Barnes, Sr., received an
offer for the Acme and in his usual impetuous fashion
closed with it in twenty-four hours. He came
home that momentous day at three instead of five,
and save for the time when Barnes, Sr., received
her promise to be his wife, he never received a finer
reward than that which greeted his announcement
to her of this decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so, you old prodigal,&#8221; choked Barnes, as
he grasped his father&#8217;s hand, &#8220;you&#8217;ve come home,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prodigal?&#8221; stammered his father, though with
tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of all the years you&#8217;ve wasted in riotous
earning,&#8221; exclaimed the son. &#8220;You can thank
old Van Patten for your conversion. You two men
have got to meet. He wasted five years in riotous
pride. But he&#8217;s come home, too, now. We&#8217;re all
home except Joe, and&mdash;well, I&#8217;m back in the <i>old</i>
home any way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, sonny?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;Nothing. I&#8217;m going to get Joe back now if I
have to go to Alaska for him, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to keep Barnes, Sr., in
New York during the following week, but for that
matter it was no easy matter for Barnes himself to
stay. But he couldn&#8217;t leave until he had settled
this other affair, and his father refused even to visit
the old farm without him. In the meanwhile, too,
Mr. Van Patten became insistent. He had been
able to see his daughter and sister for the first time
in three years, and now was eager almost to the
point of petulance to see his son. He could not
understand why the boy couldn&#8217;t come down for
a day at least. It was becoming more and more
difficult to quiet him. The girl showed plainly
enough in her letters the distress under which they
all labored. Matters were fast reaching a crisis.</p>

<p>It was at this point that he received the wire from
Eleanor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe on way home. Don&#8217;t know when he will
get here. You&#8217;d better come back if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Come back? Nothing else counted. He found
his mother in her dressing-room kneeling before a
trunk filled with old letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;I take the next train
for Chester.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up with moist eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>&#8220;Give her&mdash;my love,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But mother&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter how it turns out, Dick. My boy
loves her, so&mdash;I love her too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Dad,&#8221; choked Barnes, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t time to
see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes boarded the train with all the excitement
of a boy making his first journey. He took a seat
in the smoking-car, filled his pipe, and adjusting
his knees comfortably against the wooden card-table
before him, settled down to deep reflection. A man
with an obtrusive arrangement of a large dress-suit
case and much rattling of newspapers took the seat
facing him. He would meet her, Barnes dreamed,
in the sitting-room. She would wear her China silk
with the polka dots in it. It would be at about sunset
time, so that the gold in her hair would be more
than ever in evidence as it always was when the
sun took it slantwise. The ivory forehead would
be flushed with the lightest crimson; her lips would
be like damson preserves; and she would hold
herself like a Venetian noblewoman.</p>

<p>His thoughts were interrupted by the voice of
the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lies which are circulated about Alaska,&#8221;
declared the latter with spirit, &#8220;would fill a book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes glanced up at the man with some interest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
He saw a young fellow with a decent if somewhat
brazen face. His wide felt hat was set at a rakish
angle and his clothes were a trifle over emphasized.
The fellow was evidently referring to something he
had read in the New York paper which he held in
his big hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;They ought to jail men who slander a country
like that,&#8221; he further declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; inquired Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble? Why, the man who wrote this
couldn&#8217;t have been within a thousand miles of
Alaska. The stuff is libel&mdash;nothing else. You&#8217;d
think from this that the place was up near the
North Pole somewhere; you&#8217;d think all we had to
eat was icicles; you&#8217;d think we lived in huts and
wore a couple of feet of fur the year round. You&#8217;d
think we were all a gang of wild Indians who
wouldn&#8217;t know a street car by sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; observed Barnes, straightening up, &#8220;I
suppose you <i>do</i> lack many of the modern conveniences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by a good deal,&#8221; answered the stranger
with heat. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got everything a red-blooded
man needs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hail from Alaska yourself?&#8221; inquired
Barnes with growing interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I do.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>&#8220;Ever happen to hear of a town called &#8216;The
Last Chance&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heard of it? Why, I live there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; faltered Barnes, &#8220;did you ever happen
to hear of one Van Patten?&#8221;</p>

<p>He held his breath for the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear of it? Why, that&#8217;s my name!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Joe Van Patten?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe Van Patten.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes pressed down the ashes in his pipe. He
relighted the tobacco with deliberate carefulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to know me,&#8221; broke in the young
man uneasily, &#8220;but I&#8217;m hanged if I remember
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. My name is Barnes. I met your family
a while ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a fact?&#8221; exclaimed Van Patten.</p>

<p>The information seemed to check rather than promote
loquaciousness on the part of the young man.
He settled back uneasily in his seat and drummed
nervously on the table. Barnes discerned now a
certain family resemblance which would have been
more pronounced had the man been in more conventional
Eastern garb. There was nothing in his
face to indicate viciousness&mdash;at worst nothing but
stubbornness and selfishness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand you&#8217;re interested in mining?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
began Barnes, in the hope of getting him to talk
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up to my neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You left &#8216;The Lucky Find&#8217; well?&#8221; he inquired
much as John had inquired of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to say they haven&#8217;t heard back here
of the strike?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Lucky Find,&#8217;&#8221; announced Van Patten,
&#8220;is to-day the best paying mine within a hundred
miles of &#8216;The Last Chance.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes nodded. After all, when analyzed, that
was not necessarily a very rash statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, look here,&#8221; exclaimed Van Patten, &#8220;take
a peek at this.&#8221;</p>

<p>And before Barnes&#8217; astonished gaze Van Patten
spread out one of the identical gorgeous certificates
which he himself had described to Aunt Philomela.
There it was within touch&mdash;the very thing he had
seen the man draw out when sitting in the hut by
the side of three-fingered Bill. He was glad to
have one thing at least substantiated. It was
swirled over with a bewildering design of engraved
spirals. Across its face the name of the mine was
dashed in a flourishing script that reminded him of
the exhibition writing of an old-time teacher of
penmanship. Each certificate proclaimed that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
represented one hundred shares of stock in &#8216;The
Lucky Find&#8217;&mdash;par value one hundred dollars.
Barnes held the crinkling papers in his hand a
moment as though suspecting still that this was only
some particularly vivid piece of dreaming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just had these made in New York,&#8221; explained
Van Patten.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are very pretty,&#8221; commented Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And growing prettier every day,&#8221; answered Van
Patten. &#8220;That stock is at a premium. A month
ago we struck it rich&mdash;real gold this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man spoke as though he, at least, believed
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That ought to be good news for the stockholders,&#8221;
said Barnes, thinking of John.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will put every mother&#8217;s son of &#8217;em where
they need do no more worrying,&#8221; declared Van
Patten proudly.</p>

<p>He sank back comfortably into his seat as though
this statement settled satisfactorily most of the big
affairs of the universe.</p>

<p>If what the boy said was true, Barnes was very
glad for those back in the mellow brick house. It
would simplify Aunt Philomela&#8217;s accounts and make
John&#8217;s gray hairs less pathetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;You came East to place your stock on the market?&#8221;
inquired Barnes with fresh suspicion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come back to make good,&#8221; answered Van
Patten. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come back to pay some of my
debts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That ought to make you a welcome visitor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; faltered Van Patten with what
appeared to be more or less genuine emotion. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve used my folks very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long since you&#8217;ve been home?&#8221; asked
Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Years?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad and I had a bit of a scrap, and I cut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heard from him lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A month or so ago I got a letter. He was sick
and wanted me to come home, but I was strapped
and I couldn&#8217;t. It was just before we made the
strike. I wouldn&#8217;t tell him I was busted. When
you quit home with your dander up, you want to
make good before you come back, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It saves your pride,&#8221; admitted Barnes.</p>

<p>He met Van Patten&#8217;s eyes with frank friendliness.
He found himself beginning to sympathize
in a way with the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose Dad thought I didn&#8217;t use him very
well,&#8221; ran on Van Patten, &#8220;but that can&#8217;t be helped
now. I&#8217;ll square things with him when I see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes waited.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>&#8220;Say,&#8221; exclaimed Van Patten with enthusiasm,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to give the Dad the time of his life
in these next few years. I&#8217;m going to show him
something of this country. He&#8217;s been too busy to
travel, but I&#8217;m going to make him go back to Alaska
with me. Why, do you know we&#8217;ve got a country
up there as large as all the United States east of
the Mississippi river if you take out Alabama, Florida,
Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and West
Virginia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Barnes, mildly. &#8220;I knew that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, there&#8217;s over half a million square miles
up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be exact, five hundred and eighty-six miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Van Patten leaned forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, stranger,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;do you come
from there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your claim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;well, you see I haven&#8217;t located it yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long you been down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes extended his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we were traveling farther the same
way,&#8221; declared Van Patten.</p>

<p>The train was even then drawing close to the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
station huddled in among the houses. Van Patten
began to gather up his traps.</p>

<p>&#8220;I get off here,&#8221; explained Van Patten.</p>

<p>Barnes, too, rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; he announced.</p>

<small>A YOUNG PRODIGAL COMES HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon the platform, Van Patten looked
around with the query,</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up your way,&#8221; answered Barnes, nodding in
the direction of the brick house. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you
walk a bit with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but what I will,&#8221; answered the
other. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t anything but a dress-suit case,
and I feel like stretching my legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes led the way, and the other fell into step
at his side. The road was going in the right direction
now. It was as though every dusty fern, every
whispering birch, every stalwart pine pointed towards
the brick house. And Eleanor herself seemed
very close to him. It was as though she were keeping
pace the other side of him. How the old world
sang of her! The sun was dropping towards the
horizon line, seeking, as he knew, her black hair.
An oriole, high in an elm, was caroling her name.
The lazy locusts were rattling like gray-haired crones
over their tea&mdash;of her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>He felt his attitude towards Van Patten changing.
The keen sentences which he had framed by
the bedside of the sick father lost their edge with
every foot he neared her. All the passion and bitterness
went from them. There still remained the
fact of the thoughtless wording of the letter, but he
seemed to be less and less the man to play the judge
upon it. This man by his side was not he whom he
had pictured by the letter-box. Yet he kept repeating
to himself that the son had not come back at a
sick man&#8217;s call; that he had left his father to his
loneliness. There still remained the duty, which
surely fell upon him rather than her, of telling this
man what had happened. He braced himself to
this task.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord,&#8221; exclaimed Van Patten after they had
proceeded the matter of a hundred rods in silence,
&#8220;father will be surprised. Eleanor wrote that his
eyes had gone back on him. It&#8217;s hard luck to be
blind at such a time of year, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s also a bit of a surprise waiting
for <i>you</i>,&#8221; said Barnes.</p>

<p>The boy stopped in his tracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;A surprise?&#8221; he repeated anxiously. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t mean to tell me that father&mdash;that anything&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has partially recovered his sight,&#8221; put in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
Barnes, glad to relieve the look in the young man&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>Van Patten dropped his suit-case. He took out a
handkerchief and ran it over his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gad!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You frightened me.
But that&mdash;why, that&#8217;s the best news ever. That&#8217;s
something like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still another surprise,&#8221; began Barnes.
&#8220;I&mdash;perhaps we&#8217;d better sit down here by the
side of the road a minute. There are two or three
things you ought to know before you see your
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing serious,&#8221; Barnes reassured him, &#8220;but
what I&#8217;ve got to tell you may strike you as a bit
queer. I haven&#8217;t got used to it yet myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes sat down beneath a big pine and Van
Patten, watching him uneasily, took a place beside
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; began Barnes, &#8220;when your letter
came a month ago, affairs at the house were in a bad
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I was a bit hasty in that letter,&#8221; stammered
Van Patten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under the circumstances, you were,&#8221; agreed
Barnes. &#8220;Your father was in bad shape&mdash;sort of
pining away for you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>&#8220;For me? I didn&#8217;t think he cared that
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He cared a great deal,&#8221; said Barnes. &#8220;So, for
that reason, we didn&#8217;t show him your letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t?&#8221; exclaimed Van Patten eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We tore it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Van Patten gave a sigh of relief, but the next
second he looked curiously at this stranger who evidently
had played so important a part in his personal
affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; he said finally, &#8220;but just where
did <i>you</i> come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the arrival of the letter,&#8221; answered Barnes.
&#8220;I happened to be passing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The letter-box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t see&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sister received the letter. She was crying
over it when I came along. She was afraid if she
read it to your father it would kill him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! I didn&#8217;t know it was that bad. I was
busted and sore and&mdash;but I didn&#8217;t mean to make
it that bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes letters sound worse than we intend
when we write them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you?&#8221; persisted Van Patten.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a stranger, but when I heard your sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
crying, I stopped. She was very much excited, and
on the spur of the moment she confided in me. I
advised her to tear up the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God for that!&#8221; exclaimed the boy, &#8220;but
I don&#8217;t see yet where you came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we talked over how we could prevent your
father from knowing you didn&#8217;t intend to come
home. You see if he had learned that he would
have just dropped his head back on the pillow and
died.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I thought he never wanted to lay eyes on
me again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He grew young while he was sick,&#8221; explained
Barnes. &#8220;He came back home while he was sick,
and he wanted you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did you manage it? How&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I played the prodigal,&#8221; explained Barnes,
simply. &#8220;I took your part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You made him believe you were me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he <i>did</i> believe it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was blind and very anxious. So he believed.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Van Patten stared at Barnes in
silence. Then he stammered,</p>

<p>&#8220;Stranger, I reckon I owe you more than Dad
does.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>&#8220;Neither of you owes me anything,&#8221; answered
Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll settle that later,&#8221; said Van Patten, earnestly.
&#8220;But Dad&mdash;didn&#8217;t he call your bluff
at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I left when his sight began to improve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you work that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him I had to go to New York on business.
From New York I wired you, and&mdash;here
you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never got your wires,&#8221; answered Van Patten,
&#8220;but, thank God, here I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to back me up in what I told him
about Alaska,&#8221; smiled Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord,&#8221; gasped Van Patten, &#8220;you did go the
limit. But trust me to play out the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes stared dreamily across the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he hesitated, &#8220;I ought to go along
with you for a day or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll need you,&#8221; said the boy, reaching for his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;But your father mustn&#8217;t meet me. It won&#8217;t
do to allow him to make comparisons. Once he
sees you with his own eyes, he&#8217;ll put aside all
doubts. The others will have to know, of course,
but we can keep them quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The others?&#8221; questioned Van Patten.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>&#8220;Carl, for one,&#8221; answered Barnes. &#8220;Your sister,
I understand, is engaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sis engaged?&#8221;</p>

<p>Van Patten made his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s time I got home right
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two started again and on the rest of the short
walk Barnes devoted himself more to details. As
well as he was able, Barnes sketched rapidly the
minor events of those two weeks and repeated once
more stories he had made up for the father. Van
Patten listened intently, but he groaned at mention
of three-fingered Bill and the description of the hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gad!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;it&#8217;s a crime to back up
such yarns as those, but I suppose you did the best
you could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The best I could,&#8221; answered Barnes, soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s my fault anyway,&#8221; put in the boy
quickly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not long on religion, but if conversion
means anything, I guess it means just the
changed way I feel now about father and home.
I&#8217;ve got you to thank for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I converted myself in the process,&#8221; smiled
Barnes, &#8220;which is more than some preachers do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He passed the place by the road where he had
found the girl lying bruised on the grass, and from
this point on, his lips were set. But when he came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
in sight once more of the little brick house, his jaws
relaxed a trifle. It looked as warm and peaceful
and sunshiny as it had the first day he saw it. He
led the way to the little Dutch door, and lifted the
brass knocker. It sent an echo through the house
which was answered by John. The latter looked both
startled and pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Eleanor able to come downstairs?&#8221; inquired
Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. She said she was expectin&#8217; you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll ask her to step into the sitting-room?&#8221;</p>

<p>Van Patten followed his leader uneasily, and
paced the room almost as though fearing this interview.
But when his sister appeared he had reached
her side in a jiffy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sis,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I&#8217;m back&mdash;back home!&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated the fraction of a second, her eyes
upon Barnes. The latter bowed without speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe,&#8221; she murmured doubtfully.</p>

<p>But the boy seized her in his arms almost fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t afraid of me, little sister?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe, Joe,&#8221; she trembled, and lifted her lips to
his.</p>

<p>From upstairs came the fairy tinkle of a silver
bell. Barnes started. The girl looked wildly about.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s Dad,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Barnes stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father sees quite clearly now?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;What&mdash;what are we
going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe must go to him,&#8221; insisted Barnes. &#8220;Send
Aunt Philomela down to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe himself looked frightened. He hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell your father,&#8221; suggested Barnes, &#8220;that
you&#8217;ve had word &#8216;The Lucky Find&#8217; is on its feet.
He&#8217;ll be so glad for you that he&#8217;ll forget everything
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if he suspects?&#8221; gasped Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;If worst comes to worst,&#8221; said Barnes, &#8220;send
for me. We&#8217;ll have to tell him then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe turned towards the door. Barnes placed his
hand upon the young man&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your nerve,&#8221; he warned, &#8220;and play the
game hard. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve all been doing
here&mdash;even Aunt Philomela.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor escorted her brother to the old man&#8217;s
room and without waiting came down immediately
with her aunt. Both women were quite breathless.
They stood close together as though half expecting
to hear a scream. Barnes crossed at once to Aunt
Philomela and took her frail hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>&#8220;Buck up,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;The boy will carry it
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad that <i>you</i> are
here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; answered Barnes. &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you
both better be seated?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela obeyed humbly and took a chair
near the window. Eleanor remained standing by
her side.</p>

<p>Barnes thought the girl looked paler than when
he had left. She seemed less sure of herself. The
strain of the last few weeks had told upon her. He
felt a strange lightness of the head as he noticed
these things. The phrases he had formulated to
say on the way down here all vanished and in their
place came a dozen swift sentences which he had no
right to utter. Consequently, he was dumb and the
silence became embarrassing. Aunt Philomela broke
the tension a little by exclaiming,</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t live through this last week again
for a hundred million dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; answered Barnes, briefly.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela glanced up quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does Joe look?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all as I feared,&#8221; stammered the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blood tells,&#8221; nodded Aunt Philomela with a
trace of her old spirit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>The two women listened. Barnes himself half
expected to hear at any second the warning tinkle of
the silver bell. He roused himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is Carl&#8217;s arm?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>Both women started. It was Aunt Philomela
who replied,</p>

<p>&#8220;It is getting along very well, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Patten caught her breath and looked
away. Barnes noticed it. He sought her eyes with
a question. She flushed scarlet. Upon the moment
he determined to see Carl as soon as he could leave.</p>

<p>Like three discussing a grave crisis in a sick room,
they talked on in strained, jerky little sentences until
Joe came down again. At the boy&#8217;s entrance, Aunt
Philomela arose. It was clear at a glance that Van
Patten was unnerved, but it was also clear that he
had succeeded. He came direct to Aunt Philomela
with his hand extended.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Joe?&#8221; she stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt,&#8221; he answered unsteadily, &#8220;I&#8217;ve paid big
for all my cussedness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little old lady took his hand and patted his
shoulder. He turned to Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, ye gods,&#8221; he added solemnly, &#8220;Alaska has
paid big, too!&#8221;</p>

<small>MAN TO MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>As Barnes hurried through the little Dutch door
on his way to see Langdon, he felt like an exchanged
prisoner going to rejoin his colors. He was conscious
of one big emotion&mdash;that of freedom. However
slight the chances, so long as a man may fight,
victory is at least within his grasp. Yet Barnes
was neither confident nor even sanguine. His
thoughts did not go so far as to speculate upon the
result. It was enough that he need no longer remain
passive.</p>

<p>His plan was simple. He would tell Langdon the
whole story and claim the rights of which he had
been deprived. He would claim the privilege of
ignoring the engagement which had not yet been
publicly announced, which had not as yet even
been announced to her father, so far as it might
restrict him in any honorable approach to the girl.
He would make Langdon see that he did not do this
presumptuously, but simply on the ground that he
was entitled to fight for his pictures as Langdon
fought for his symphonies. Eleanor would, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
course, remain in ignorance of the agreement. She
was unrestrained by any code and so could then
choose, if at all, as her heart dictated.</p>

<p>Barnes found Langdon dressed and sitting in the
sun before the house with his arm in a sling. He
had lost both weight and color. He greeted Barnes
with what seemed like a genuine welcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re all glad to see you back, Joe,&#8221; he
said earnestly. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been devilish uneasy up
at the other house without you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; answered Barnes. &#8220;Some
devilish queer things have been happening up there
during these last few weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carl glanced up quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>Barnes sat down on the turf a little way from
Langdon and stared at the saffron road. The
tawny ribbon seemed such an integral part of all
the strange occurrences of this last month that he
turned to it now, as to a comrade, for help in explaining.</p>

<p>&#8220;In some ways,&#8221; he began, &#8220;because you&#8217;re an
artist it makes it easier to tell you; but in other
ways that fact makes it harder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon leaned forward anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Is anything
wrong&mdash;up there?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; answered Barnes,
&#8220;but something is wrong right here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With you, Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With you and me,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>Langdon paused for a moment, and then, through
half-closed lips, he groaned, &#8220;Yes, something is
wrong with me. But how did you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes lifted his eyes and studied the strained
white face of the other. It was his turn to be surprised.
He glanced at the bandaged arm.</p>

<p>Langdon shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your sister, Joe,&#8221; explained Langdon.
&#8220;There&#8217;s something about her I don&#8217;t understand.
She hasn&#8217;t been herself since you left.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me any more,&#8221; he commanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for this chance to talk it over
with you, Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any right to listen,&#8221; Barnes hurried
on. &#8220;But I have something to say to you&mdash;that&mdash;that
may help you out. Only I don&#8217;t know just how
to begin. I want you to understand, in the first
place, that we&#8217;ve all been as square as we knew how&mdash;that
what has happened has been, in a way, inevitable.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>Langdon sat as fixed as a marble statue. Barnes
turned his eyes back to the saffron road.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he began, &#8220;it all came about by
chance. I was walking along this road when I found
her by the letter-box, crying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Found who?&#8221; demanded Langdon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor. She had just received a letter from
her brother, saying he wouldn&#8217;t come home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon looked dazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;From her brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Joe. You see I&#8217;m not her brother at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon rose slowly from his chair. Barnes too
rose. He forgot for the moment his own rights in
this matter. He felt as though he were confessing
to an imposition. It occurred to him that this was
just the way that Aunt Philomela must have first
looked upon the plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then who the devil are you?&#8221; demanded Langdon,
aggressively.</p>

<p>&#8220;No relation to the family at all,&#8221; answered
Barnes. &#8220;To you&mdash;just a fellow artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon turned his eyes towards the brick house.
He repeated almost automatically,</p>

<p>&#8220;No relation at all. Just a fellow artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Joe himself,&#8221; ran on Barnes, &#8220;is up there
now. He came back to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon tottered. Barnes seized his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, old man,&#8221; he urged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>But Langdon shook himself free and stepping back
a pace stared like a man at bay. The attitude helped
Barnes to justify himself again. They stood now
man to man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Langdon,&#8221; said Barnes, quietly, &#8220;the position
was easier for you than it was for me. I was forced
to listen&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have saved me from confiding in
you,&#8221; broke in Langdon through half-closed lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saved you?&#8221; answered Barnes. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
think I would have saved myself that, if it had
been possible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have seemed like a good joke to you,&#8221;
said Langdon.</p>

<p>Barnes caught his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered slowly, &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t much of a
joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated and then went on,</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps when I&#8217;m done, you can see just how
much of a joke it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I mean that all the
time I have felt the same towards Eleanor that you
do. I mean that I have been fighting for my pictures
just as you have been fighting for your symphonies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
The difference is that&mdash;until Joe came back&mdash;I
have had to fight myself, too. I have had to stand
back helpless and look on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221; demanded Langdon.</p>

<p>Barnes took a long breath. He met Langdon&#8217;s
hot eyes steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve come to claim my
rights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221; inquired Langdon.</p>

<p>&#8220;The privilege of making my love known to her&mdash;the
privilege of winning her if I can. The privilege,&#8221;
he added slowly, &#8220;of putting that sunrise we
looked at together into colors as you would put it
into music.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Langdon stared at him in silence.
Then he groped for his chair. He sat leaning forward
with his forehead in his hand. When he finally
looked up, his face was set.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;I think you have that right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That and nothing more,&#8221; replied Barnes. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want you to think that Eleanor herself has&mdash;has
given me any encouragement in this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even&mdash;since you&#8217;ve come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not had time to exchange a half dozen
words with her since then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon relapsed into silence and Barnes hurried
on. He was very anxious to make himself clearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
understood. He didn&#8217;t want Langdon to think he
was taking an unfair advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Langdon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m not chivalrous
enough to wish you success. It&#8217;s too serious
a business for both of us. But I can say frankly
that I want the girl to choose for her own happiness.
And I don&#8217;t see a pennyworth of difference between
us. We are both artists; we are both honest; we
have both, I should say, about the same amount of
talent whatever that may count; we offer her about
the same things. We&#8217;d both buckle down to make
her happy for all there is in us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think women choose for those things,&#8221;
answered Langdon, dully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I neither,&#8221; agreed Barnes. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
how they choose. Perhaps they don&#8217;t choose at all.
We hold out the straws and they draw. All is I want
to put my straw in with yours, Langdon. I want a
chance&mdash;because of all it means to me and my pictures.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon rose wearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t much use discussing it,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You&#8217;re right&mdash;devilish right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes hesitated about offering his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t go ahead exactly as friends,&#8221; he
faltered, &#8220;but we needn&#8217;t be enemies, need
we?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Langdon. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t think
anything we ourselves may do consciously will play
a very important part in the affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I either. So here&#8217;s my hand to a fellow
artist anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon took it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you off and on during the next few
weeks I suppose,&#8221; said Barnes, &#8220;but there&#8217;s no need
of ever bringing this up again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon straightened himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t get your name,&#8221; he observed with something
of a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barnes, I ought to tell you that whatever
formal engagement existed between Miss Van Patten
and myself has already been canceled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord,&#8221; exploded Barnes. &#8220;You mean&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That we found we had been over hasty. That is
all. There has been no&mdash;misunderstanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I still mean to make her my wife if she concludes
it is for her happiness. This new development may
help her to decide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why that&#8217;s great,&#8221; exclaimed Barnes. &#8220;Then
we&#8217;re both back on our mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Langdon, grimly. &#8220;And I&#8217;m
going in now to telephone her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>&#8220;And I,&#8221; concluded Barnes. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll go
back to the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-day, Barnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-day, Langdon,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>And turning abruptly Barnes swung off down the
road at as fast a pace as he could make.</p>

<small>THE PURPLE RIM</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Langdon had mentioned thus casually a turn in
the affairs of Eleanor which to the girl herself
marked a crisis. It is no small matter when one
awakes to the realization that one does not understand
oneself. And this is especially true when
one&#8217;s life hitherto has been as simple as the rule of
three. Suddenly to discover that one is complex&mdash;to
face in a flash the mystifying X in life&#8217;s equations&mdash;is
to grow from a girl to a woman in a
minute.</p>

<p>That eventful morning a week ago when Carl
had appeared to her pale-faced and looking like a
wounded soldier and had made his sharp, fervent
plea, she had answered out of a full heart and as
to an old friend, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; It came as a simple
almost inevitable climax. It did not seem a momentous
decision; it had involved no great fluttering
of the heart. When she conveyed the news to
Aunt Philomela, the latter had for a moment looked
surprised, then thoughtful, and finally had solemnly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
patted her hand with the remark, &#8220;Well, my dear,
you will be safe with him at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an hour after this she had lain prone upon
the sofa pondering her aunt&#8217;s observation. Yes, she
would feel safe. Already she felt safe. She felt
again, as she did as a little girl, that she was living
in a cup bounded by the horizon line. What lay beyond
did not concern her. There would be no adventuring
over that purple rim. Should they ever
venture forth, Carl would precede her like a courier
and at every station have things ready for her comfort.
Her life would move forward as steadily, as
calmly as it now did.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Barnes had come in with
the news of his intended departure. He had broken
in upon her lazy reflections with his usual disconcerting
impetuosity. And as usual, too, he had
seemed to dash from over the horizon line. He had
made her feel less as though this boundary were a
protection. He had a way of swooping down from
unexpected angles which was discomforting to one
whose habit was to watch only the main thoroughfare.
When Aunt Philomela in a moment of fretfulness
had sputtered out before him the news of
her engagement it had come to her distinctly as
more of a surprise than when Carl himself had proposed.
It was as though it were for the first time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
announced to herself. It gave her a new sense of
responsibility which left her feeling by no means so
secure as before Barnes&#8217; entrance.</p>

<p>Then before she had time to think, Barnes had
gone. Aunt Philomela drew her chair nearer and
stroked her hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a queer boy,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;and somehow&mdash;I&#8217;m
going to miss him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been very generous to us, Aunty,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is utterly irresponsible,&#8221; she hedged.</p>

<p>Both women had a great deal with which to occupy
themselves during the next few days but they
moved always with a sense of insecurity. Carl came
over often but there was not much he could do. In
all little things he was thoughtful and he gave them
both a great deal of good advice about not worrying
and not overtaxing their strength.</p>

<p>So a week passed and Eleanor did not sleep well
at night. Yet for the life of her she could not tell
why. She had evil dreams about being stifled, about
being tied hand and foot awaiting some awful doom.
Once she called out so loudly in her sleep as to rouse
Aunt Philomela. The latter crept in timidly with
a frightened question on her lips,</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, dearie?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>The girl reached out for her aunt&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she groaned, &#8220;there seemed
to be something&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Thing?&#8221; interrupted Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;An uncanny thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela recovered her spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to tell me that Mr. Barnes&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnes?&#8221; interrupted the girl as though the
name offered some vague explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he been filling your head full of that nonsense
as he did John&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl smiled. The room seemed instantly as
full of fresh air as though a window had been
opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t that. Get back
into bed, Aunty, or you&#8217;ll catch cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela reluctantly obeyed and the girl
fell into a deep sleep which remained uninterrupted
until dawn. Then she crept to the window. It
seemed more like a sunset than a sunrise she was
watching.</p>

<p>For the next day or two she used Carl abominably.
It was impossible for her to see him. Yet he was
very patient&mdash;very sweet. He wrote her quiet,
tender little notes and spent most of his time downstairs
with Aunt Philomela. The latter came up
one evening with her face set.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; she snapped, &#8220;what I need is to get
good and vexed once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Aunty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean I almost ordered Mary to spill some hot
tea on Carl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; she continued uncompromisingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mr. Barnes&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to goodness he&#8217;d drop in for an hour this
very evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor looked up brightly,</p>

<p>&#8220;It might clear the air,&#8221; she suggested.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela was thoughtful a moment. Then
she observed, &#8220;I think in the morning you had better
see Carl.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the next morning she had received Carl. He
was very solicitous as to what had caused her relapse
and she, acting upon a sudden inspiration, tried to
admit him into the secret of her thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carl,&#8221; she said frankly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what
has come over me. Honestly I don&#8217;t. But ever
since our&mdash;our engagement I&#8217;ve felt stifled. It
may be just hysteria. But I&#8217;ve felt all hemmed in.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I know what it is,&#8221; he said tenderly.
&#8220;You feel as though you had been made a prisoner?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>&#8220;Is it that?&#8221; she questioned eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. That is it,&#8221; he decided. &#8220;Living here so
much by yourself these last few years you&#8217;ve been
very free. But I don&#8217;t want to feel that now I bind
you in anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t. That&#8217;s what I can&#8217;t understand.&#8221;
She frowned and then went on, &#8220;Why I&#8217;m just as
free as ever I was. I can move about as I wish;
I can do what I choose. There&#8217;s nothing I wish to
do that I can&#8217;t do. I guess I&#8217;m just silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carl shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we&#8217;re gripped with an idea like yours,
it isn&#8217;t silly no matter how inexplicable it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know how I feel?&#8221; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;you feel caged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;it&#8217;s that.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was wonderful how fully he understood her.
She felt even now when talking with him as though
talking to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you know how to cure me?&#8221; she asked
with a little laugh.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;By leaving the cage door open,&#8221; he answered
quickly. She caught her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need of our being formally engaged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
We can go on just as we have until we decide to get
married&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew back a little. He put in quickly, &#8220;We
needn&#8217;t even consider that now. We&#8217;ll be just
friends until the whole matter solves itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it will solve itself?&#8221; she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath. The cage door was even
now open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carl,&#8221; she whispered honestly, &#8220;already I feel
less afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus what had appeared to her a very serious
problem was settled in five minutes. And it left her
not one whit more comfortable. As she thought of
it during the day, the very fact of Carl&#8217;s acquiescence
piqued her. If the matter had been settled
after a hearty quarrel she would have felt twice as
free. As it was she was under obligations to his good
nature if nothing else.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Carl began to lose weight;
it was at this point that Eleanor began to realize
that in some way Carl had for once misunderstood
her. The discontent which oppressed her was by no
means based upon such girlish hysteria as they had
both supposed. But once at this conclusion she was
no better able to analyze her condition than before.
Her fretful nights began again and once again she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
found herself straining towards something bigger
and more intangible than had ever before come into
her life. She still felt herself caged and this time it
was by nothing less distant than the purple rim
itself.</p>

<p>She did not discuss this with Carl. She did not
mention it even to Aunt Philomela. Alone with
herself in the dark she struggled to find meaning in
it and as she struggled she discovered herself a
wilder more irrational being than she had ever imagined
existed.</p>

<p>For one thing her thoughts went back again and
again to the saffron road. Until now this path had
been significant only as furnishing a means of approach
to the house or a convenient way of access to
the green-grocer at the next village. But during the
long nights which followed, it called to her in a
more venturesome spirit. She saw it stretching
mile upon mile beyond Chester, saw it winding
through the valleys and up the hills and across
mountain ranges to the sea. It did not stop even
here. A big boat came down to meet her and carried
her across the ocean where she again picked up
the trail. She felt one with De Soto and Champlain;
one with all those who press on through strange
countries in their adventuring. And as she moved
on she was upon wings and was unafraid.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>Yet Barnes&mdash;Yes, it was Barnes who had shown
her the way&mdash;had pointed out the dangers.</p>

<p>&#8220;My soul,&#8221; he had exclaimed, &#8220;the dangers are
innumerable and terrifying.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now as she thought of them, she laughed back
at him. He had spoken of chasms and glaciers and
tangles and thorns and Indians. Well, what of
them? She joyed at thought of pitting her strength
of limb against them. She thrilled at prospect of
scrambling over them and straight on. To what?
It did not matter. She was in a state of primeval
rebellion. She yearned to get beyond these
flower-bordered paths, beyond these sheltered walls.
Carl had left the cage open but in the meanwhile,
even while beating her wings against the bars, she
had found some new power. The cage door was open
and she had no desire to hop back again among the
flowers where before she had been content. She had
seen the purple of the sky through the wires and
now she hungered to soar.</p>

<p>Still it was all very vague. It was like a dream
from which we awake with a distinct emotion of
abstract horror or joy without being able to recall
the details which cause the mood.</p>

<p>If, at times, Barnes intruded himself into the
sacred mystery of these thoughts she then instantly
regained control of herself. They were of too intimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
stuff to share. He made her self-conscious.
He made her uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Yet at other times she thought of him a great
deal. She wondered about that tragedy in his eyes
which Carl had pointed out to her. She had noticed
it particularly the day Barnes had left. If ever
a man&#8217;s eyes expressed a secret woe, his did then.
He had seen a great deal of the world and it would
be small wonder if during that time he had met
someone&mdash;someone&mdash;</p>

<p>She found it difficult to be more concrete. There
were a great many different kinds of women and
it would be very hard to visualize her whom such
a man might choose. She might be tall or slight or
dark or brunette or&mdash;she doubted if her appearance
would matter very much to such a man. She might
be gay or shy, learned or untutored, rich or poor.
She doubted if any of those things would matter
much to such a man.</p>

<p>It was impossible to conceive just what <i>would</i>
matter but she was quite sure that whatever did,
would matter a great deal. Love would be with him
a big emotion and if it went wrong, it would be a big
tragedy. Carl had seen it and she herself had caught
traces of it in the letters he had written to her father.
This week, with its problems, left her strangely
eager for his return.</p>

<small>AUNT PHILOMELA GAMBLES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Though Mr. Van Patten improved steadily during
the week after Barnes&#8217; return, the old gentleman
did not venture from his room. Joe remained
daily by his side from morning until bedtime, with
a view to establishing himself so firmly in his
father&#8217;s mind that if ever it became necessary to
introduce Barnes in his proper person it would
not be possible for the father to make comparisons.
The possibility of such a contingency was really
slight. The original deception had been practiced
upon Mr. Van Patten&#8217;s touch and hearing, and
whatever discrepancies of evidence based on these
might bob up would have little weight against what
the father was now able to see for himself. As
for contradictions in the narrative, the father&#8217;s
memory was weak and Barnes had appealed almost
wholly to his emotions. It was really not
until now that Mr. Van Patten had been able to
fix his attention at all upon details.</p>

<p>Yet it was thought advisable not to let him know
that a guest was in the house. This was no very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
difficult matter and involved nothing but a certain
amount of caution. Aunt Philomela, who had
quite recovered her spirits, disapproved of it on
general principles but admitted the wisdom of the
course.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t expect to see the end of this until I&#8217;m
in my grave,&#8221; she avowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; admitted Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I shall consider myself very lucky if I
do then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&mdash;&#8221; Barnes paused. &#8220;Well, after all,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;that depends upon how it all turns
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela looked at him curiously. She
had looked at him curiously a great many times
this last week. Barnes drew from his pocket a
handful of loose matches. He began to arrange
them with their heads in one direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have an embarrassment of riches,&#8221; he observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I like that new game you
taught me,&#8221; snapped Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;It helps one to forget the duets,&#8221; suggested
Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won most of those matches when you
didn&#8217;t have anything at all in your hand,&#8221; commented
Aunt Philomela.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>&#8220;There is little skill in winning when you hold
a Royal Straight Flush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I held four aces and even then you won.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you didn&#8217;t have the courage of your
convictions,&#8221; explained Barnes. &#8220;I had only a
pair of deuces that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela&#8217;s eyes snapped dangerously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she asserted, &#8220;I consider your gains decidedly
ill gotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had only called me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After you shoved forward a whole handful of
matches as though you held all the cards in the
pack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the game. All is fair in love and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love!&#8221; snapped Aunt Philomela in disgust.</p>

<p>But she was interrupted in further comment by
the entrance of Eleanor. She had often been interrupted
in further comment this last week by the
entrance of Eleanor.</p>

<p>The girl had regained her color at a wonderful
rate these last few days. This may have been due
to the rapid recovery her father was making, or
it may have been due to the return of her brother
and the good news he brought of &#8216;The Lucky Find,&#8217;
or it may have been due to Carl, who was noticeably
assiduous in his attentions. Barnes spent a
great deal of time trying to make out which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
was. Last night she had played duets with Carl
until ten o&#8217;clock, while Barnes and Aunt Philomela
sat at cards in the next room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you at liberty this morning?&#8221; inquired
Barnes of Miss Van Patten.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what Aunty has planned for me,&#8221;
she said dutifully.</p>

<p>&#8220;As though what I planned for anyone mattered,&#8221;
exploded Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; murmured Barnes, &#8220;that so far
we have all of us followed your plans to the
letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the beginning,&#8221; nodded Barnes. &#8220;From
the moment you sent me upstairs to see Mr. Van
Patten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? I sent you upstairs? I&#8217;m responsible for
this whole affair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But for your orders I should have gone on
again along the saffron road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of all the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Eleanor effectively stifled her aunt&#8217;s righteous
indignation by putting her arms about the thin
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Aunty, dear,&#8221; she wheedled, &#8220;don&#8217;t
mind him. Now, I&#8217;ll do anything you say. Do
you wish me to help you with your accounts?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>&#8220;Or,&#8221; put in Barnes, &#8220;do you wish us to catch
you a fish?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela rose to her feet and swept
grandly towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fish by all means,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>At the door she paused and added:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt that Mr. Barnes will find it
unnecessary to use even so much as a hook in his
fishing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hurried out leaving the girl staring in
amazement at Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;At cards last night,&#8221; explained Barnes, &#8220;I
won fifty-three sulphur matches from your Aunt&mdash;mostly
by bluffing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she murmured in relief, &#8220;that explains
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sun is almost too bright for fishing,&#8221; she
faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sun is not too bright to go down by the
brook,&#8221; he asserted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if we go, we shall have to fish,&#8221; she exclaimed
instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;We will fish even
if we catch nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went to the closet and brought out her big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
hat, the fishing-poles, the book of flies, the basket,
and, this time, the landing-net. At sight of it he
drew a deep breath. It recalled to him his oath
to the king trout. He must keep true to that
no matter what complications it brought about.</p>

<p>And she, as she gathered the things together,
grew uneasy. That, however, was nothing unusual.
She could not recall a minute in his presence when
she had ever felt anything else. One never knew
what he was going to say next or what odd turn
he would give the simplest platitudes of conversation.
She felt much safer when Aunt Philomela
was near except that even then he would generally
contrive some argument that ended by involving
them all. No&mdash;she could not honestly say that she
was any the happier for having Aunt Philomela
at hand. She could not say honestly that she did
not now look forward to a morning with Barnes
by the side of Schuyler brook. She anticipated it
with a degree of pleasure that in itself was discomforting.
She did not trust herself as she did
three weeks ago.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile she had put on her hat and
again succeeded in tying beneath her chin a most
wonderful bow-knot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t learned yet how to do that,&#8221; commented
Barnes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>&#8220;Do what?&#8221; she inquired, not recalling the former
incident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tie a bow-knot that will come untied when
you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you practiced?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must still limit myself to tying such things
as are my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is wisest,&#8221; she agreed.</p>

<p>And without giving him time to base any embarrassing
argument upon this, she led the way out
of the little Dutch door. Here the Princess joined
them. The big yellow cat had taken a fancy to
Barnes of late and was to be seen quite as often
in his company as in that of his mistress.</p>

<p>The girl forced a brisk path through the field-grass
in as matter of fact a way as though in reality
a fish for Aunt Philomela was the only thing in the
world that concerned her. Lag as he might it did
little good, and in no time they had reached the
brook.</p>

<p>It was quite obvious to Barnes that the stream
took no interest whatever in the affairs of the
brick house from which it derived its name. Its
business was solely with water-cress, white pebbles,
and golden sand. It was whimpling on its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
placid course just as unconcernedly as it did three
weeks before. If Barnes expected any encouragement
here for the deep matters he had in hand he
was disappointed.</p>

<p>Eleanor proceeded at once to put her pole together
and Barnes reluctantly followed. She
paused as he handed her the fly-book.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had such good luck before&mdash;&#8221; she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;was an especial occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>She selected a Silver Moth. As she turned away
from him he replaced the fly-book in the basket,
picked out a tiny bit of lead, and, fastening it to
the end of his line, whipped it at once into the
water. She glanced over her shoulder, surprised
at the speed he had made, but she was too late to
detect his choice. In another second her own fly
was in the water and Barnes breathed more easily.
Then he turned his attention to a more important
matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>She looked up quickly. The name came to her
fraught with new significance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I have outlived my usefulness as a
prodigal.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>&#8220;The affair has solved itself in so simple a
fashion that I had almost forgotten that part of
it,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>He looked up from his line. She was turned a
little away. When she was standing there alone
with him the matter seemed simple enough to be
sure. It had from the beginning until Carl came
in. The problem now was to find out just what
had become of Carl.</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as your father is concerned it seems to
have straightened out,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And as far as Joe is concerned,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Aunt Philomela,&#8221; he nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she agreed hastily.</p>

<p>He drew his line from the water and whipped
it afresh across the stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which leaves,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;you and Carl
and myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dropped her fly below a clump of alders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you using a Silver Moth again?&#8221; she
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he confessed.</p>

<p>She followed the bobbing end of his line a
second. He allowed it to sink below the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t make out what you <i>have</i> chosen,&#8221; she
persisted, squinting her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a secret,&#8221; he affirmed mysteriously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>&#8220;Oh, pardon me,&#8221; she apologized, with some
pique.</p>

<p>&#8220;Willingly,&#8221; he murmured politely.</p>

<p>She seemed disposed to allow both subjects to drop
but he with discomforting insistence reaffirmed,</p>

<p>&#8220;Which leaves you and Carl and myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you had a talk with Carl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And though he seems hurt, it is straightened
out as well as it can be, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t straightened out at all,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>She turned uncomfortably so that she faced him.
He met her eyes. She lowered hers. Then she
smiled. It was her only protection.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never catch a fish with your line in
the bushes,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>The current had swept the bit of lead down
stream into a clump of grass. He deliberately
began to reel in his line.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ll catch a fish anyway,&#8221; he
decided. &#8220;I&#8217;ll watch you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but that&#8217;s what you did before,&#8221; she
protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;And enjoyed it immensely,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s shirking your duties.&#8221;</p>

<p>As his line left the water she studied him in
surprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>&#8220;Why, you didn&#8217;t have on any hook at all,&#8221;
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>It was impossible to deny the fact in face of
the evidence. Without answering he detached the
sinker and continued to reel in his line. She allowed
the Silver Moth to drift into the bushes.
He called her attention to this and she grew very
red in the face.</p>

<p>It was quite clear to her now that he had enticed
her down here upon a pretext. She grew
embarrassed out of all proportion to any import
she saw in the ruse. She would have been glad
if Aunt Philomela had come along.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is you and Carl and myself,&#8221; he repeated,
as though this were a sort of apology for
his act.</p>

<p>She hastily reeled in her own line. The Princess
watched her anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>Barnes took a step towards her. At that moment
he heard the approach of someone from behind.
He looked about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;here&#8217;s Carl now!&#8221;</p>

<p>She almost dropped her pole.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re fishing,&#8221; Barnes hastened to explain, in
the hope of warding off the commonplace query
which he thought he detected upon Carl&#8217;s lips.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
But the remark the latter made was anything but
commonplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hurried down here to say good-by to you,&#8221;
he explained.</p>

<p>He uttered the words with an effort. They
seemed no part of him. The process was purely
mechanical.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by?&#8221; exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I take the noon train,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;From
New York I sail to-morrow for Munich.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t understand!&#8221; cried the girl.</p>

<p>Carl turned from her to Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Barnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that is enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes took a step forward and seized the boy&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d fight it out if I were you,&#8221; he said below
his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fight it out in Munich,&#8221; he answered
grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then God help you and&mdash;the songs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carl pressed the strong man&#8217;s hand that held
his.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need of praying for you,&#8221; he
answered.</p>

<p>Eleanor stepped forward in a daze.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>&#8220;But Carl&mdash;&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>He seized her hand, gripped it for a second, and
without a word started away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carl,&#8221; she called after him, &#8220;wait! We&#8217;re
going back to the house with you.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br />


<small>IN WHICH EVERYONE LEARNS SOMETHING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Twice now Eleanor had seen in a man&#8217;s eyes
the dumb pain of an unuttered tragedy,&mdash;once
when Barnes had gone back to New York; again
this afternoon, when Carl had bade her good-by
and been driven off down the saffron road. In
the first case she had played no part, though the
ache of it still haunted her; in the second it was
clear that she was the direct cause. And yet as
she stood by the sitting-room window after supper
and retraced this last summer, she saw nothing
that she could have managed differently. Incident
had followed incident with apparent inevitability.
Of course she should have been surer of
herself before giving Carl such encouragement, but
under the circumstances of the moment she had
acted with what wisdom she then had. The unrest,
the doubts developing into certainty, had followed
later.</p>

<p>But argue as she might, she was left with the
feeling that she had been pitifully weak and was
decidedly unworthy of the love which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
offered her. She needed someone in whom to confide&mdash;someone
to help her straighten out this
tangle. Joe could not help, nor Aunt Philomela,
nor even her father. She thought of just one man
who might understand, and that one man was in
the next room talking with her aunt. Even as
she thought of him the one man entered and came
across to her side. Whereupon she murmured an
excuse and started to leave. But Barnes checked
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;You&#8217;re worried.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had touched her arm just the fraction of a
second. She looked towards the door, startled. She
felt very uncomfortable now that she was alone
with the one man. Instead of clarifying matters,
he seemed to complicate them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You take Carl&#8217;s departure much to heart?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I feel very much at fault,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>She was looking out the window across the rows
of bright flowers, across the green fields, to the
horizon line. To Barnes she appeared like a painting
by Rossetti. With her head uplifted, her eyes
half closed, as though in weary confusion, she
looked like the Beata Beatrix.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because Carl loves you?&#8221; he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>She caught her breath. It sounded such a crude,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
barbaric fact when he expressed it. She looked
for some escape. She prayed that he might leave
her alone. He stood before her as though barring
her way.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;He is mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think he is mistaken,&#8221; he answered
quietly.</p>

<p>He seemed bent upon depriving her of the one
shred of hope to which she had been clinging. He
made her feel even guiltier than before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barnes,&#8221; she pleaded, &#8220;let&#8217;s not talk of
it any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only way to settle things,&#8221; he answered
gently. &#8220;There&#8217;s no use of hiding our
heads in the sand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Carl has gone. It&#8217;s all settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered deliberately. &#8220;It&#8217;s still
very much mixed up for all of us. We can&#8217;t help
Carl very much except by admitting the truth, and
that is that he loves you. He would have made
beautiful songs for you if you had loved him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cruel of you to make me feel so guilty,&#8221;
she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;You misunderstand,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;His
love was independent of anything you did consciously.
You would have had to be other than
yourself to have prevented that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>&#8220;I should have known myself better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t correct the past with what we learn,
but the Future&mdash;there is where our wisdom
counts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will that count for Carl?&#8221; she exclaimed,
with a queer little cry.</p>

<p>He thought a moment. Then he shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I was thinking
only of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&mdash;I don&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing matters very much for you,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that?&#8221; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you are now sure of yourself; that you
are sure you do not really love him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started, but she did not reply. The stark
sunlight which had been pounding hotly at the
earth all day was now fading. The birds were
getting sleepy.</p>

<p>It was at about this time of day that Barnes had
first met her. Then she had been only a strikingly
beautiful picture, and now&mdash;what a deal more
she was to him now! Until this moment his love
for her had seemed so big that it had been almost
impersonal. Circumstances had forced him to regard
it so. It had been almost like some of the
big fine dreams he had dreamed about his Art.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
Now, in a second, with that question, he felt her
for the first time as a warm, palpitating, human
being. As an artist he had admired her first,
then as a mere man, then as a lover; but now,
as he waited for her reply, it was as Richard
Barnes that he loved her. For the first time he
had to wrestle hard with himself for control. He
hungered to feel her in his arms, to brush with
his lips the scarlet in her cheeks, which was as
rose upon ivory. He yearned to mingle kisses
with the black of her hair, which had gold in it.
He gathered himself together and repeated his
question,</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure of that?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>There must have been some new quality to his
voice, because she shrank back from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure of anything,&#8221; she stammered.</p>

<p>The one man frightened her. The one man now
drove all thought of Carl out of her bewildered
brain. The one man was in himself a yet keener
problem than any she had so far had to face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; he insisted, &#8220;that is one thing you
must search your soul to answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why must I answer now?&#8221; she parried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; he said quietly&mdash;&#8220;because if you
love him I must wire him to-night on my way to
Chester.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>&#8220;You&mdash;you are going, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>The words fell from her lips unconsciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish me to bring back Carl,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t
do any good to bring him back.&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt his hand upon her arm for the second
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure of that?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Yes. That is the pity of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The pity of it,&#8221; he answered soberly. Then
again, &#8220;The pity of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see,&#8221; she hurried on, surer of her
ground now, &#8220;I <i>ought</i> to love him. There is
every reason why I should love him. And yet I
don&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>She uttered the words as though it were a confession
from which she expected Barnes to withdraw
in horror. Leaning forward he searched her
eyes as though once for all to penetrate the hidden
gallery of her heart. She closed her eyes, frightened
by his earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure of that?&#8221; he asked again.</p>

<p>She nodded guiltily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pitiful thing to say,&#8221; she murmured,
&#8220;but it&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held her breath to see what he would answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
to that. For what seemed to her an eternity he
didn&#8217;t say anything. When he did speak she was
almost tempted into hysterical laughter. But she
managed to control herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;let&#8217;s go up on the
hill back of the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced into his blue eyes. When he led
the way she followed. They went out by the little
Dutch door and he closed it behind them. It was
as though he closed a thousand doors behind her.</p>

<p>She stepped into the path, and it seemed to
stretch in an endless vista beyond the top of the
hill. She thought of De Soto and La Salle and
Champlain, and knew how they must have felt as
they turned their backs upon their home friends.
And yet, so far as anything had been said, this
was a simple venture to the top of a hill to view
a sunset. All about her lay the nooks and crannies
with which she had been so long familiar. She
glanced back at the house. It had receded many
miles. She was alone. That was what frightened
her. The years before counted for nothing&mdash;her
old friends counted for nothing. She felt like one
daring for the first time into deep water without
a supporting arm. And there was no shore back
of her. She must go forward across the golden
green waves, which sang in unreckoned miles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
leagues in front of her. She was alone. She had
now only her own heart to guide her. All the
tender souls who had ever stood about her might
be eager, but they could give no answer to the
questions which beset her suddenly on this simple
venture to the top of a hill. Her mother, perhaps&mdash;but
in the end even her mother must have
been left behind.</p>

<p>Through the old garden they went, and the
flowers smiled back at her. She plucked a half-folded
poppy and grasped its stem as a child
clings to a skirt. She stopped a moment to play
with the others, but he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she went on again up the winding path which
she had trod no later than yesterday. The hill
loomed before her like one of those purple-capped
piles she had seen in the sunset clouds. The sun
caught her hair slantwise and brought out the gold
in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you tired?&#8221; he asked, as she lagged a
little.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Oh, no,&#8221; she answered breathlessly.</p>

<p>She hurried to his side. There was nothing else
to do. The path was blocked behind but it was
wonderfully clear in front. Not so much as a
cobweb barred her progress.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>Upon the hill-top they found great banners of
purple and gold waving before their eyes against
a background of blue and green. Below them the
verdure of the rolling fields and maple clumps
were also tinted with gold. The air was soft, and
yet it sparkled as though fine gold were being
sifted down from above. A wonderful world, and
they two stood alone in it. Populous cities subsiding
their turmoil; men and women going about
the ordinary routine of their lives; ships putting
to sea and men being carried to hospitals&mdash;all
those things there might be for others outside the
circumference of their eyes, but to them mere phantasies,
pleasant and unpleasant. They stood alone
here and the fact of grappling kingdoms and great
deeds elsewhere were but the tawdriest distant
incidents.</p>

<p>Before their eyes the colors strutted the skies
like vain peacocks showing their plumage. But
always, whether the dye was of crimson or green
or purple or the lightest shade of old-rose, the gold
shone through it to quicken. It was as though the
theme were gold. It came as a prelude. It ran
triumphant through every movement, and in the
end it controlled the tinted postlude which softened
imperceptibly into the golden blue of the
finale.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>With this her thoughts grew more restful. She
no longer felt afraid though still she stood alone.
He was speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember,&#8221; he asked gently, &#8220;what I
told you about the true adventurers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About the little children?&#8221; she answered
nodding.</p>

<p>&#8220;And about the lovers?&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she was forced to admit.</p>

<p>He had spoken of the dangers in a way that
had frightened her. Looking down upon this same
scene he had pointed them all out to her. And
yet now it was difficult to grasp them.</p>

<p>&#8220;When two go adventuring hand in hand the
dangers are halved,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>It was as though he had answered her unspoken
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he added, &#8220;they are halved again and
then halved once more until they are all gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes had grown distant. Her breath was
coming in little gasps. The true explanation of
these last weeks came in upon her now. Twice
she had seen in a man&#8217;s eyes the dumb pain of an
unuttered tragedy, but now she remembered only
the first time,&mdash;when the one man had left her
to go back to New York. In sudden fear she
turned to see if any trace of the pain were still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
there. She found herself looking into blue eyes
which were as quick with fine gold as the sky
itself. They made her dizzy. She tottered. Then
she felt herself in the grasp of strong arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Into the West,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;straight into
the West, my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her head dropped to his shoulder. She was
trembling, and once again he heard the plaintive
little sound he had heard by the letter-box. In
amazement he tried to lift her head, but with a
sob she only burrowed it deeper. So he kissed her
hair and patted her very gently and waited.</p>

<p>Whether it was one minute later or one year
later that Barnes heard her voice he could not have
told. He was way off beyond the horizon line
when he caught her broken statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t lift my head until&mdash;until it&#8217;s
dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>The statement did not seem to disturb him. He
kissed her hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very stupid,&#8221; she gasped.</p>

<p>He kissed her hair again.</p>

<p>&#8220;And very weak,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>He kissed her hair once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;and altogether unworthy of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon he took her head in his hands and
held it back. Her eyes were tight closed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No! No!&#8221; she pleaded.</p>

<p>He brought his lips to hers. For a second she
allowed it so. Then she opened her eyes wide&mdash;very,
very wide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear you,&#8221; he breathed. &#8220;We have started
on the Great Adventure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, she saw a man&#8217;s face
glorified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we must go back to Aunt
Philomela.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her heart fell and all the way down the hill
she clung to his arm. Every now and then he
stopped and looked deep into her eyes. He made
her very uncomfortable; deliriously uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Aunt Philomela was waiting for them in the
sitting-room. When they entered she glanced up
as sharply as she had the day Barnes had first made
his entrance. The girl drew back and waited for
Barnes to speak. He said nothing. She was sure
her face was red and that her hair was in disorder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; demanded Aunt Philomela.</p>

<p>With a quick little run the girl threw herself
on her knees by her aunt&#8217;s side and buried her
face in her lap. Barnes waited. Aunt Philomela&#8217;s
black eyes grew dangerous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she demanded again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>&#8220;Oh, Aunty,&#8221; cried the girl, &#8220;can&#8217;t&mdash;can&#8217;t you
see?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Aunt Philomela stared at Barnes.
Then she stooped and kissed the girl&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered slowly, &#8220;I see. I saw
long ago.&#8221;</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
